"1","2pac","Changes","Greatest Hits",2011,"Come on, come on
I see no changes, wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living, should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein' poor and even worse I'm black
My stomach hurts, so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch

Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares
One less hungry mouth on the welfare

First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal the brothers
Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other
It's time to fight back that's what Huey said
Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead

I got love for my brother but we can never go nowhere
Unless we share with each other
We gotta start makin' changes
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers

And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the devil take a brother, if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things changed, that's the way it is

Come on, come on, that's just the way it is
Things will never be the same, that's just the way it is
Aww, yeah

Come on, come on, that's just the way it is
Things will never be the same, that's just the way it is
Aww, yeah

I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted

Take the evil out the people they'll be acting right
'Cause mo' black and white is smokin' crack tonight
And only time we chill is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other

And although it seems heaven sent
We ain't ready, to see a black President
It ain't a secret don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks

But some things will never change
Try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game
Now tell me, what's a mother to do?
Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you

You gotta operate the easy way
I made a G today, but you made it in a sleazy way
Sellin' crack to the kid, I gotta get paid
Well hey, well, that's the way it is

Come on, come on, that's just the way it is
Things will never be the same, that's just the way it is
Aww, yeah

Come on, come on, that's just the way it is
Things will never be the same, that's just the way it is
Aww, yeah

We gotta make a change
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes
Let's change the way we eat, let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other
You see, the old way wasn't working so it's on us to do
What we gotta do, to survivem

And still I see no changes, can't a brother get a little peace?
There's war in the streets and war in the Middle East
Instead of war on poverty, they got a war on drugs
So the police can bother me

And I ain't never did a crime, I ain't have to do
But now, I'm back with the facts givin' 'em back to you
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up
Crack you up and pimps smack you up

You gotta learn to hold ya own
They get jealous when they see ya, with ya mobile phone
But tell the cops, they can't touch this
I don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this
That's the sound of my tool, you say it ain't cool?
My mama didn't raise no fool
And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the pay backs
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Comin' back after all these years
Rat-a-tat, tat, tat, tat, that's the way it is
That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same, that's just the way it is
Aww, yeah
That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same, that's just the way it is
Aww, yeah
Some things will never change",5330000

Makaveli in this... Killuminati, all through your body
The blow's like a twelve gauge shotty
Uh, feel me!
And God said he should send his one begotten son
to lead the wild into the ways of the man
Follow me; eat my flesh, flesh and my flesh

[Chorus (Makaveli):]
Come with me, Hail Mary
Run quick see, what do we have here
Now, do you wanna ride or die
La dadada, la la la la

[Makaveli]
I ain't a killer but don't push me
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to getting pussy
Picture paragraphs unloaded, wise words being quoted
Peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it
Bow down, pray to God hoping that he's listening
Seeing niggas coming for me, to my diamonds, when they glistening
Now pay attention, rest in peace father
I'm a ghost in these killing fields
Hail Mary catch me if I go, let's go deep inside
the solitary mind of a madman who screams in the dark
Evil lurks, enemies, see me flee
Activate my hate, let it break, to the flame
Set trip, empty out my clip, never stop to aim
Some say the game is all corrupted, fucked in this shit
Stuck, niggas is lucky if we bust out this shit, plus
mama told me never stop until I bust a nut
Fuck the world if they can't adjust
It's just as well, Hail Mary

[Chorus 2X]

[Makaveli]
Penitentiaries is packed with promise makers
Never realize the precious time the bitch niggas is wasting
Institutionalized I lived my life a product made to crumble
But too hardened for a smile, we're too crazy to be humble, we balling
Catch me father please, cause I'm falling, in the liquor store
That's the Hennessee I hear ya calling, can I get some more?
Hail 'til I reach Hell, I ain't scared
Mama checking in my bedroom; I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it, what can I do
One life to live but I got nothing to lose, just me and you
on a one way trip to prison, selling drugs
We all wrapped up in this living, life as Thugs
To my homeboys in Clinton Max, doing they bid
Raise hell to this real shit, and feel this
When they turn out the lights, I'll be down in the dark
Thuggin eternal through my heart, now Hail Mary nigga

[Chorus 2X]

[Kastro]
They got a APB, out on my Thug family
Since the Outlawz run these streets, like these skanless freaks
Our enemies die now, walk around half dead
Head down, K blasted off Hennessee and Thai
Trying it, mixed it, now I'm twisted blisted and high
Visions of me, Thug living getting me by
Forever live, and I multiply survived by Thugs
When I die they won't cry unless they coming with slugs

[Young Noble]
Peep the whole scene and whatever's going on around me
Brain kinda cloudy, smoked out feeling rowdy
Ready to wet the party up, and whoever in that motherfucker
Nasty new street, slugger my heat seeks suckers
on the regular mashing in a stolen black Ac Integ-ra
Cock back, sixty seconds 'til the draw that's when I'm dead in ya
Feet first, you got a nice gat but my heat's worse
From a Thug to preaching church, I gave you love now you eating dirt
Needing work, and I ain't the nigga to put you on
Cause word is bond when I was broke I had to hustle 'til dawn
That's when sun came up, there's only one way up
hold ya head and stay up, to all my niggas get ya pay and weight up

[Kastro]
If it's on then it's on, we break beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate
to this shit I don't got, be the shit I gotta take
Dealing with fate, hoping God don't close the gate
If it's on then it's on, we break beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate
to this shit I don't got, be the shit I gotta take
Dealing with fate, hoping God don't close the gate

[Chorus (repeats in background)]

[Prince Ital]
We've been traveling on this wayward road
Long time 'til I be take a 'eavy load
But we ride, ride it like a bullet
Hail Mary, Hail Mary
We won't worry everything will come real
Free like the bird in the tree
We won't worry everything will come real
Yes we free like the bird in the tree
We running from the penitentiary
This is the time for we liberty

"4","2pac","Me Against The World","Me Against The World",1995,"It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world, baby
I got nothing to lose
It's just me against the world
Stuck in the game
Me against the world, baby

Can you picture my prophecy?
Stress in the city, the cops on top of me
The projects is full of bullets, the bodies is dropping
There ain't no stopping me
Constantly moving while making millions
Witnessing killings, leaving dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Can't reach the children cause they're illing
Addicted to killing and the appeal from the cap peeling
Without feeling, but will they last or be blasted?
Hard headed bastard
Maybe he'll listen in his casket -- the aftermath
More bodies being buried
I'm losing my homies in a hurry
They're relocating to the cemetery
Got me worried, stressing, my vision's blurried
The question is will I live? No one in the world loves me
I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feeling this anger
Don't wanna make excuses, cause this is how it is, what's the use?
Unless we're shooting no one notices the youth
It's just me against the world baby

Could somebody help me? I'm out here all by myself
See ladies in stores, Baby Capone's, living wealthy
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreaming
Seeing Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons, already crazy and screaming
I guess them nightmares as a child
Had me scared, but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route? For a crooked Outlaw
Veteran, a villain, a young thug, who one day shall fall

Everyday there's more death, and plus I'm dough-less, I'm seeing more reasons
For me to proceed with thieving scheme on the scheming and leave they peeps grieving
Cause ain't no bucks to stack up, my nuts is backed up
I'm bout to act up, go load the Mac up, now watch me klacka
Tried making fat cuts, but yo it ain't working
And Evil's lurking, I can see him smirking
When I gets to perving, so what?
Go put some work in, and make my mail, making sales
Risking 25 with a 'L', but oh well

With all this extra stressing
The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath
When will I finally get to rest through this suppression?
They punish the people that's asking questions
And those that possess, steal from the ones without possessions
The message I stress: to make it stop study your lessons
Don't settle for less - even the genius asks his questions
Be grateful for blessings
Don't ever change, keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best, don't let the pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded, and things don't go the way you planned it
Dreaming of riches, in a position of making a difference
Politicians and hypocrites, they don't wanna listen
If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change
It wasn't nothing like the game
It's just me against the world

That's right
I know it seem hard sometimes but uhh
Remember one thing
Through every dark night, there's a bright day after that
So no matter how hard it get, stick your chest out
Keep your head up, and handle it",3524567

I guess change is good for any of us
Whatever it take for any of y'all niggas to get up out the hood
Shit, I'm wit cha, I ain't mad at cha
Got nuttin but love for ya, do your thing boy

Yeah, all the homies that I ain't talk to in a while
I'ma send this one out for y'all, kna' mean?
Cause I ain't mad at cha
Heard y'all tearin' up shit out there, kickin' up dust
Givin' a motherfucker,
Yeah, niggas, mad at cha
'Cause I ain't mad at cha

Now we was once two niggas of the same kind
Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line
You was just a little smaller but you still roller
Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll
Member when you had a jheri curl didn't quite learn
On the block, witcha glock, trippin off sherm
Collect calls to the till, sayin' how ya changed
Oh you a Muslim now, no more dope game
Heard you might be comin' home, just got bail
Wanna go to the Mosque, don't wanna chase tail
I seems I lost my little homie he's a changed man
Hit the pen and now no sinnin' is the game plan
When I talk about money all you see is the struggle
When I tell you I'm livin' large you tell me it's trouble
Congratulation on the weddin', I hope your wife know
She got a playa for life, and that's no bullshittin'
I know we grew apart, you probably don't remember
I used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her
And I can see us after school, we'd bomb!
On the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
Now the whole shit's changed, and we don't even kick it
Got a big money scheme, and you ain't even with it
Hmm, knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker bad
Go toe to toe when it's time for roll you got a brother's back
And I can't even trip, 'cause I'm just laughin' at cha
You tryin' hard to maintain, then go head
'Cause I ain't mad at cha
(Hmm, I ain't mad at cha)

I ain't, mad, at cha (I ain't mad at cha)

I ain't, mad, at cha

We used to be like distant cousins, fightin', playin' dozens
Whole neighborhood buzzin', knowin', that we wasn't
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
I'm gettin' blitzed and I reminisce on all the times we shared
Besides bumpin' n grindin' wasn't nothin' on our mind
In time we learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back, to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony lovin the way the guns blow
And even though we separated, you said that you'd wait
Don't give nobody no coochie while I be locked up state
I kiss my Mama goodbye, and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said I'll return but I gotta fight the fate's arrived
Don't shed a tear, cause Mama I ain't happy here
I'm through trial, no more smiles, for a couple years
They got me goin' mad, I'm knockin' busters on they backs
In my cell, thinkin, ""Hell, I know one day I'll be back""
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl I'll be there, so prepare, to get fucked down

The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin' at cha
Cause youse a down ass bitch, and I ain't mad at cha

I ain't, mad, at cha (I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't, mad, at cha (A true down ass bitch, and I ain't mad at cha)

Well guess who's movin up, this nigga's ballin' now
Bitches be callin' to get it, hookers keep fallin' down
He went from nothin' to lots, ten carots to rock
Went from a nobody nigga to the big, man on the block
He's Mister local celebrity, addicted to move a key
Most hated by enemy, escape in the luxury
See, first you was our nigga but you made it, so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you why you faded, in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin' so high off that bomb hopin' we make it, to the better days
'Cause crime pays, and in time, you'll find a rhyme'll blaze
You'll feel the fire from the niggas in my younger days
So many changed on me, so many tried to plot
That I keep a glock beside my head, when will it stop?
Til God return me to my essence
'Cause even as a adolescents, I refuse to be a convalescent

So many questions, and they ask me if I'm still down
I moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now?
They got so much to say, but I'm just laughin' at cha
You niggas just don't know, but I ain't mad at cha

I ain't, mad at cha (and I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't mad (hell nah I ain't mad at cha) at cha

When I was young me and my mama had beef
17 years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, scared to go home
I was a fool with the big boys, breakin' all the rules
Shed tears with my baby sister
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies
The same drama, when things went wrong we blamed mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey I'd see the penitentiary
One day, runnin' from the police that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend mama
You always was the black queen mama
I finally understand for a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man
You always was committed, a poor single mother on welfare
Tell me how you did it, there's no way I could pay you back

But the plan is to show you that I understand

You are appreciated

Lady, don't ya know we love ya (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't ya know we love ya

Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love for my daddy 'cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry
'Cause my anger wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless
But all along I was lookin' for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty 'cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox
I love payin' rent when the rent's due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
'Cause when I was low you was there for me
You never left me alone because you cared for me
And I can see you comin' home after work, late
You're in the kitchen tryin' to fix us a hot plate
Just workin' with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every Thanksgiving

But now the road got rough, you're alone

Tryin' to raise 2 bad kids on your own
And there's no way I could pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand

You are appreciated

Lady, don't ya know we love ya (And dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't ya know we love ya

Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
'Cause through the drama, I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy, there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me

And all the extra love that you gave me

I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle, everyday gotta roll on
And there's no way I could pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand

I couldn't trust my own homies just a bunch a dirty rats
Will I, succeed, paranoid from the weed
And hocus pocus try to focus but I can't see

And in my mind I'ma blind man doin' time
Look to my future 'cause my past, is all behind me
Is it a crime, to fight, for what is mine?
Everybody's dyin' tell me what's the use of tryin'

I've been trapped since birth, cautious, 'cause I'm cursed
And fantasies of my family, in a hearse
And they say it's the white man I should fear
But, it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here

I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Jealousy inside, make 'em wish I died

'Cause every time I breathe, I think they killin' me

I'm having nightmares, homicidal fantasies
I wake up stranglin', danglin' my bed sheets
I call the nurse 'cause it hurts, to reminisce
How did it come to this? I wish they didn't miss

Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here
'Cause even thugs cry, but do the Lord care?
Try to remember, but it hurts
I'm walkin' through the cemetery talkin' to the dirt

I'd rather die like a man, than live like a coward
There's a ghetto up in Heaven and it's ours, Black Power
Is what we scream as we dream in a paranoid state
And our fate, is a lifetime I hate

Dear mama, can you save me? And fuck peace
'Cause the streets got our babies, we gotta eat

Ain't no such thing as self-defense in the court of law

Got him, lurked him, crept the fuck up on him
Sold a half a million tapes now everybody want him

After talkin' behind my back like a bitch would
Tellin' them niggaz, ""You can fade him"", punk I wish you would
It be them same motherfuckers in your face that'll rush up in your place
To get your safe, knowin' you on that paper chase

Grass, glass, big screen and leather couch
My new shit is so fetti already sold a key of ounce
Bitch, remember Tupac and 4-Tay
Them same two brothers dodgin' bullets representin' the Bay

Pac when you was locked down, that's when I'll be around
Start climbing up the charts, so sick, but they tried to clown
That's why they ride the bandwagon still be draggin' sellin' lies
Don't think I don't see you haters, I know you all in disguise

Guess you figure you know me 'cause I'm a thug
That love to hit the late night club, drink then buzz
Been livin' lavish like a player all day
Now I'm 'bout to floss 'em off, player shit with 4-Tay

Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z.
Keep Ya Head Up
Little somethin for my godson Elijah and a little girl named Corinne

[Verse One:]

Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
I give a holler to my sisters on welfare
Tupac cares, and don't nobody else care
And uhh, I know they like to beat ya down a lot
When you come around the block brothas clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive but don't forget, girl keep your head up
And when he tells you you ain't nuttin don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you you should leave him
Cause sista you don't need him
And I ain't tryin to gas ya up, I just call em how I see em
You know it makes me unhappy (what's that)
When brothas make babies, and leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies, that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up
I know you're fed up ladies, but keep your head up

[Chorus]

Keep ya head up, oooo child things are gonna get easier
ooooo child things are gonna get brighter [2x]

[Verse Two:]

Aiyyo, I remember Marvin Gaye, used to sing ta me
He had me feelin like black was tha thing to be
And suddenly tha ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew, and had a smoke or two
And I realize momma really paid the price
She nearly gave her life, to raise me right
And all I had ta give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic, and make it to tha bright screen
I'm tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay tha rent
And in the end it seems I'm headin for tha pen
I try and find my friends, but they're blowin in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems tha rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up, and still keep from gettin wet up
You know it's funny when it rains it pours
They got money for wars, but can't feed the poor
Say there ain't no hope for the youth and the truth is
it ain't no hope for tha future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother, for turning my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive, cause it's a setup
And even though you're fed up
Huh, ya got to keep your head up

[Chorus]

[Verse Three:]

And uhh
To all the ladies havin babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by ya lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids, even if nobody else want em
Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and comeback for more
Cause ain't nuttin worse than when your son
wants to kno why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain you was dealt this
hell of a hand without a man, feelin helpless
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dying inside, but outside you're looking fearless
While tears, is rollin down your cheeks
Ya steady hopin things don't all down this week
Cause if it did, you couldn't take it, and don't blame me
I was given this world I didn't make it
And now my son's getten older and older and cold
From havin the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin Benz
I'm still tryin to hold on to my survivin friends
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up, but
please... you got to keep your head up",1639584
"9","2pac","Thugz Mansion (Acoustic)","Better Dayz",2002,"2pac: Shit, tired of getting shot at
Tired of getting chased by the police and arrested
Niggas need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong, that's just for us
Niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
You na'mean?
Where do niggas go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga, that's why we go to Thug Mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a G
At Thug Mansion

A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times
I once contemplated suicide and would of tried
But when I held that 9, all I could see was my moma's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowing it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Praying hard for 'Better Dayz', promise to hold on
Me and my dogs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We finally found a spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's
We still visualize places, that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go in fast
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at 'Thugz Mansion'

J. Phoenix: Every corner every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little henessy, lay back and cool
Every hour but it's all good.
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothing but peace, love
Street passion, every ghetto needs a Thugz Mansion

Nas: A place where where death doesn't reside
Just thugz who collide
Not to start beef but spark trees, no cops rolling by
No policemen, no homicide
No talking to streets, no reason,
for nobody's momma to cry
See I'm a good guy, I try to stick around with my daughter
But if I should die, I know all of my albums support her
This whole year's been crazy
Ask the holy spirit to save me
Only difference from me and Ossie Davis gray hair, maybe
Cause I feel like my eyes saw too much suffering
I'm just twenty-some-odd years
I done lost my mother and I cried tears of joy
I know she smile on her boy, I dream of you more
My love goes to Afeni Shakur

Cause like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in the war
And just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more
Cause one day we'll all be together,
Sipping heavenly champagne where angels soar
With golden wings, in thug's mansion
J. Pheonix: Every corner every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little henessy, lay back and cool
Every hour but it's all good.
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothing but peace, love
Street passion, every ghetto needs a Thugz Mansion
2pac: Dear Mama don't cry, your baby boy's doing good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drinking peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday
Sang sitting there kicking it with Malcolm, 'til the day came
Little LaTasha sure grown
Tell the lady in the liquor that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us
When Miles Davis cutting loose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
that passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm asking
Remember this face, save me a place, in 'Thugz Mansion'
J. Phoenix: Every corner every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little henessy, lay back and cool

Don't mean that we could hit the sheets
Baby, I can see, that you don't recognize me
I'm Shock-G, the one who put the satin on your panties
Never knew a hooker that could sham me

Your home girl you went to school with
That's cool, but did she tell you about her sister
And your cousin thought I wasn't
See, weekends was made for michelob
But it's a monday, my day
So just let me hit it, yo

Fingertips on the hips as I dip
Gotta get a tight grip, don't slip
Loose lips, sank ships, it's a trip
I love the way she licks her lips
See me jockin'
Put a little twist in her hips
Cuz Im watchin'
Conversations on the phone
'Till the break of dawn
Now we all alone, why the lights on?
Turn em off, time to set it off
Get you wet n soft
Somethings on your mind, let it off
You don't know me
You just met me
You wont let me
Well if I couldnt have it, (silly rabbit)
Why you sweatin' me?
Its a lot of real Gs doin' time
Cuz a groupy bit the trooper told a lie
You picked the wrong guy
Baby if you're too fly
You need to hit the door
Search for a new guy
Cuz I only got one night in town

Turn it up loud
Hahaha, ahahaha, hey man
You a little sucker for love, right?
Word up, hahahahaha

I shoulda seen
you was trouble right from the starrrrt, taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
we had some problems but we workin at it, and now
the arguments are gettin loud, I wanna say
But I can't help from walkin out just a little way
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be a man it just wasn't me
But now I'm searchin for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don't be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be you're killin me with your jealousy
Now my ambition's to be free
I can't breathe, cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap
I hear you callin me to come back, I'm a sucka for love
that's right, sucka for love

[Chorus: Eric Williams]

What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
[repeat 2X]

Just when I thought I broke away and I'm fellin happy
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Don't wanna fall for it, but in this case what could I do? So now I'm back
to makin promises to you, tryin to keep it true
What if I'm wrong, a trick to keep me on and on
Tryin to be strong and in the process, keep you goin
I'm bout to lose my composure, I'm gettin close
To packin up and leavin notes, and gettin ghost
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head I'm feelin low, losin control
My heart is sayin leave, oh what a tangle web we weave
when we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin calls at the house, guess you cheatin
That's all I need to hear cause I'm leavin, I'm out the do'
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
Cause now I know you've been cheatin, I'm a sucka for love
damn, sucka for love... sucka for love
sucka for love

[Chorus]

Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings'll go away
It wasn't always a hit and run relationship
It use to be love, happieness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don't worry bout it we can do it now I'm under pressure
Make a decision cause I'm waitin, when I'm alone
I'm on the phone havin secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
but I need your faith in me, I'm a sucka for love
sucka for love, know you ain't right G but yet I'ma sucka for love

I'ma sucka for love, sucka for love
Sucka for love

Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
I give a holler to my sisters on welfare
Tupac cares, if don't nobody else care
And uhh, I know they like to beat ya down a lot
When you come around the block brothas clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive but don't forget, girl keep your head up
And when he tells you you ain't nothin' don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you you should leave him
Cause sista you don't need him
And I ain't tryin to gash up, I just call em how I see em
You know it makes me unhappy
When brothas make babies, and leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies, that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up
I know you're fed up ladies, but you gotta keep your head up

Keep ya head up, oooo child things are gonna get easier
Ooooo child things are gonna get brighter Aiyyo, I remember Marvin Gaye, used to sing ta me
He had me feelin like black was tha thing to be
And suddenly tha ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew, and had a smoke or two
And I realize momma really paid the price
She nearly gave her life, to raise me right
And all I had ta give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic, and make it to tha bright screen
I'm tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay tha rent
And in the end it seems I'm headin for tha pen
I try and find my friends, but they're blowin in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems tha rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up, and still keep from gettin wet up
You know it's funny when it rains it pours
They got money for wars, but can't feed the poor
Say there ain't no hope for the youth and the truth is
It ain't no hope for tha future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother, for turning my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive, cause it's a setup
And even if you're fed up
Huh, ya got to keep your head up

And uhh
To all the ladies havin babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by ya lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids, even if nobody else want em
Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and comeback for more
Cause ain't nuttin worse than when your son
Wants to kno why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain you was dealt this
Hell of a hand without a man, feelin helpless
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dying inside, but outside you're looking fearless
While tears, is rollin down your cheeks
Ya steady hopin things don't all down this week
Cause if it did, you couldn't take it, and don't blame me
I was given this world I didn't make it
And now my son's getten older and older and cold
From havin the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin Benz
I'm still tryin to hold on to survivin friends
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up, but

Lost in the whirlwind, ninety-six, Bonnie and Clyde
Me and my girlfriend, do one-eighty-five when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin, born as a ghetto child
Raised in this whirlwind (c'mon)
Our childhood years recall the tears heart laced with venom
Smokin sherm, drinkin malt liquor, father forgive her

Hands on the steering wheel, blush, while she bail out bustin
Fuck em all, watch em fall screamin, automatic gunfire
Exorcisin all demons
Mafias on the side, my congregation high, ready to die
We bail out to take the jail back, niggaz united

Touch you in every secret place, I can hardly wait
To bust freely, got you red hot, you so happy to see me

I knew deep inside, baby girl would always be mine

With you, bought you some shells when you turned twenty-two
It's true, nothin compares to the satisfaction
That I feel when we out mashin, me and my girlfriend

All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end, just me and my girlfriend

I was too immature
To understand your ways, inexperienced back in the days
Caused so many arguments and strays
Now I realize how to treat ya, the secret to keep ya
Bein faithful now cause now cheatin's lethal
We closer than the hands of time, deeper than the drop of mankind
I trust you dearly, I shoot blind
In time I clock figures, droppin niggaz as we rise
We all soldiers in God's eyes - now it's time for war
Never leave me baby, I'm paranoid, sleepin witcha
Loaded by my bedside crazy
Jealous when you hang with the fellas, I wait patiently alone
Anticipated for the moment you come home
I'm waitin by the phone this is true love, I can feel it
I've had a lot of women in my bed, but you the realeast
So if you ever need me call, I'll be there through it all
You're the reason I can stand tall, me and my girlfriend

I love finger fuckin you, all of a sudden I'm hearin thunder
When you bust a nut, niggaz be duckin or takin numbers
Love to watch you at a block party, beggin for drama
While unleashin on the old timers, that's on my mama
I would trade my life for yours, behind closed doors
The only girl that I adore, everything I'm askin for
Talkin to me beggin me to just, take you around
Seventeen like Brandy you just Wanna Be Down
Talkin loud when I tell you be quiet you move the crowd
Bustin rounds, activatin a riot, that's why I love you so
No control, down to roll, unleash
After a hit you break apart, then back to one piece
Much love to my one and only girlfriend, the world is ours
Just hold me down, baby witness the power
Never leave a nigga alone, I love you black or chrome

Tha money and tha fame made us all change places
Could it be through tha misery
That came to past,
the hard times make a true friend afraid to ask,
for currency,
but u could run to me when u need me,
I'll never leave honestly someone to believe in as u can see.
It's a small thang through and true
What can I do real homies help you get through
And comin' new he'd do tha same thang if he could
Cuz in tha hood true homies make you feel good
And happy times we be actin' up call tha cops
Bringin' tha cease to tha peace that was on my block
It never stop, when my mama ask me will I change
I tell her yeah but it's clear I'll always be tha same

So you know I don't hang around tha house much
This all night money makin' got me outta touch, shit
Ain't flashed a smile in a long while
An unexpected birth worst of tha ghetto childs
My attitude got me walkin' solo
Ride out alone in my low-low
Watchin' tha whole world move in slow mo
For quiet times I disappear and listen to tha ocean
Smokin' pots think my thoughts
Then it's back to coastin'
Who can I trust in this cold world
My phoney homie had a baby by my own girl
But I ain't trippin' I'm a playa
I ain't sweatin' him
I sex his sister had her mumble like like a Mexican
His next of kin
No remorse it was meant to happen
Besides rappin' tha only thing I did good was scrappin'

So take, these Broken Wings
I need your hands to come & heal me once again,

Now who's to say if I was right or wrong?
To live my life,
As an Outlaw all alone
Remain strong in this planet full of playa hataz
They conversate but Death Row full of demonstrators
And in tha end drinkin' henessey made all my enemies envy me
So cold when I flow eliminatin' easily
Falls to they knees, they plead for their right to breath
While beggin' me to keep tha peace haha
Well I can see close into achieve
In times of danger don't freeze time to be a G
Follow my lead I supply everything you need
An ounce of game and tha trainin' to make a G'
Remember me?
As an Outcast Outlaw
Another album out that's what I'm about - more,
gettin' raw 'till tha day I see my casket
Buried as a G' while tha whole world remembers me

Only in Cali where we riot not rally to live and die
In L.A. we wearin Chucks not Ballies (yeah, that's right)
Dressed in Locs and khaki suits and ride is what we do
Flossin but have caution we collide with other crews
Famous because we throw grands
Worldwide let 'em recognize from Long Beach to Rosecranz
Bumpin and grindin like a slow jam, it's Westside
so you know the Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A.
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down

Grab a nigga and take me to Heaven

Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone I grew up amongst a dying breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me can you feel me
I'm not living in the past, you wanna last?
Be the first to blast Remember Kato
No longer with us; he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets, now rest in peace
Is there heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears

I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

Now that I'm struggling in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen
And fuck the world cause I'm cursed, I'm having visions
Of leaving here in a hearse, God can you feel me?
Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain
Show me some happiness again, I'm going blind
I spend my time in this cell, ain't living well
I know my destiny is Hell Where did I fail?
My life is in denial and when I die
Baptized in eternal fire I'll shed so many tears

I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

Now I'm lost and I'm weary So many tears
I'm suicidal so don't stand near me
My every move is a calculated step, to bring me closer
To embrace an early death, now there's nothing left
There was no mercy on the streets, I couldn't rest
I'm barely standing, bout to go to pieces, screamin' peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons trying to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched, sparking the flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just a misery
Painting a picture of my enemies killing me, in my sleep
Will I survive 'til the mornin' to see the sun
Please Lord forgive me for my sins, cause here I come

I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

Lord knows I tried, been a witness to homicide
Seen drive-bys takin' lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, getting high
This ain't the life for me, I wanna change
But ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to getting crazy
Disillusioned lately, I've been really wanting babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady cause she's a product of this poison
I'm hearing noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys, can't take no more
I'm fallin' to the floor; beggin' for the Lord to let me in

Remember me I'm ya homie that was down to brawl
Sippin' Hennessy hanging with the clowns and

we had bitches by the dozens oh we fuckin' cousins
You can throw ya middle finger if ya feel me loc
a nigga just got paid and we still was broke
It took time but finally the cash was mine
all the rewards of a hustler stuck in the grind
Look around and all I see is snakes and faces

They straight busted and can't be trusted fuck y'all

Fuck all y'all

Ain't no love reminiscing on how close we was
way back in the day before they put the crack in the way
and heeyyy how much money can you stack in a day
It's gettin' rough collect calls from my niggas in court
I recollect we used to ball now just living's enough
I stand tall in the winter summer spring or fall
Thug for life scrawled all across the wall
and all about my dollars make me wanna holla
drop an album sell a million give a fuck about tomorrow
I know it's gettin' crazy after dark
these marks keep on huffin' and puffin'
ain't no fear in my heart

What's going on in the ghetto still struggle and strive

I still roll with the heater smokin' chocolate thai
In 94 I'll be going solo

too many problems with my own

so I'm rolling do-do
Fuck all y'all
Fuck all y'all

Fuck all y'all

got me locked in these chains
and hey nigga what the fuck is you wailin' 'bout

Brenda's got a Baby

I hear Brenda's got a baby
But, Brenda's barely got a brain
A damn shame
The girl can hardly spell her name
(That's not our problem, that's up ta Brenda's family)
Well let me show ya how it affects tha whole community
Now Brenda never really knew her moms
and her dad was a junky
Went in debt to his arms, it's sad
Cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know
Just cause your in tha ghetto doesn't mean ya can't grow
But oh, that's a thought, my own revelation
Do whatever it takes ta resist tha temptation
Brenda got herself a boyfriend
Her boyfriend was her cousin, now lets watch tha joy end
She tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family
Who didn't really care to see, or give a damn if she
Went out and had a church of kids
As long as when tha check came they got first dibs
Now Brenda's belly's gettin bigger
But no one seems ta notice any change in her figure
She's 12 years old and she's having a baby
In love with tha molester, who's sexin her crazy
And yet through all she thinks that he'll be with her forever
And dreams of a world with tha two of them are together,
whatever
He left her and she had tha baby solo, she had it on tha
bathroom floor
And didn't know so, she didn't know, what ta throw away and
what ta keep
She wrapped tha baby up and threw him in tha trash heep
I guess she thought she'd get away
Wouldn't hear tha cries
She didn't realize
How much tha little baby had her eyes
Now tha babys in tha trash heep balling
Momma can't help her, but it hurts ta hear her calling
Brenda wants ta run away
Momma say, you makin' me lose pay, and social workers here
everyday
Now Brenda's gotta make her own way
Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay
No money no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job
She tried ta sell crack, but end up getting robbed
So now what's next, there ain't nothin left ta sell
So she sees sex as a way of leavin hell
It's payin tha rent, so she really can't complain

Prostitute, found slain, and Brenda's her name, she's got a

baby

Hoping God forgive me

I'm no longer innocent
Casualties of fame
Made a lot of money, seen a lot of places
And I swear I seen a peaceful smile on my mama's face
When I gave her the keys to her own house
This your land
Your only son done became a man
I'm watchin time fly
I love my people do or die
But I wonder why
We scared to let each other fly

Mama pushed me out her womb, told me nigga get paid

It's got me addicted to the pleasure and the pain it's inflicted

Damn it's like a motherfucking plague that spreads
It's epidemic,
Forgotten, forgot, and it got worse
I keep my head on straight, makin money cause it's cursed
Makin money makes a difference day by day
So you gotta stay paid, no doubt
Day in and day out
This life is like a vicious cycle called fightin to live
No matter how hard you try, you see death,
You gotta die

Or dear life leaving dumb

They aged and experienced, but they can't even tell ya
Or tell me
That there'll be light at the end of the road
Why?
Cause they don't even know

by accepting Jesus Christ as our personal Lord and saviour
And as the Lord does return in the coming seven days

Niggaz, get off your ass if you plan to be rich
There's ten rules to the game, but I'll share with you two
Know, niggaz gon' hate you for whatever you do
Now rule one -- get your cash on, M.O.B.
That's Money Over Bitches, cause they breed envy
Now rule two is a hard one, watch for phonies

Hey drop that shit boy

[Verse One: 2Pac]

My adversaries cry like hoes fully eradicate my foes
My lyrics explode on contact, gamin you hoes
Who else but Mama's only son, fuck the phony niggaz I'm the one
Say my name, watch bitches come, now fire
when ready, stay watchin now figure, increase speed
Make you motherfuckers bleed from your mouth quicker
Plus all these niggaz that you run with, be on some dumb shit
Trick on the hoes, I ain't the one bitch
Holla my name and witness game official, it's so sick
Have every single bitch that came witchu, on my dick
Plus this alcohol increases the chance to be deceased
I'm movin you stupid bitches, vicious telekenesis
Am I reachin your brain? Nigga how can I explain?
How vicious this Thug motherfucker came
When I die, I wanna be a livin legend, say my name
Affiliated with this motherfuckin game, with no more pain

I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain

Plus all you busters is jealous, pull your gun out and blast
I dare you niggaz to open fire, I'll murder that ass
And disappear before the cops come runnin, my glock's spittin rounds
niggaz fallin down clutchin they stomach
It's Westside, Death Row, Thug niggaz on the rise
Busters shot me five times, real niggaz don't die
Can ya hear me? Laced with this game, I know you fear me
Spit the secret to war, so cowards fear me
My only fear of death is reincarnation
Heart of a solider with a brain to teach your whole nation

I got my hands on your hips, no time to bullshit
Freaky bitch, come give me kiss
Tell them niggaz from other areas, brothers from here
So obsessed with this money makin it ain't nothin we fear
Now they label me a troublemaker, cause I'm a ridah
Death to you playa haters, don't let me find ya
Mama made me rugged, baptised the public
Now you hard thugs, nigga don't you love it

Dear sister
Got me twisted up in prison
I miss you
Crying
Looking at my nieces and my newphews picture
They say don't let this cruel world get you
Kinda suspicious,
Swearing one day you might leave me
for someone that's richer
Twist the cap off the bottle
I Take a sip And see tommorrow
Gotta make it if I have to Beg and Borrow
Reading love letters
late night, locked down, and quiet
If brothers don't receive their mail
Best believe we riot
Eating Jack mat
Staring at walls of Silence
Inside this cage
Where they captured all my rage and violence
In time I learned a few lessons
Never fall for riches
Apologizes to my TRUE sisters
Far from bitches
Help me raise my black nation
Reparations are due
Its true
Caught up in this world
I took advantage of you
So tell the babies how I love them
Precious boys and girls
Born black in this white mans world
and all I heard was

Who knows what tommorrow brings
In this world where everyone lies
Where to go
No matter how far I find
To let you know
That You're not alone

Being born with less
I must confess
Only adds on to the stress
Two gunshots to my homies head
Died in his rest
Shot him to death
and Left him bleeding for his family to see
I pass his casket
Gently asking
Is there heaven for G's?
My homeboys doing life
His baby's mama be stressing
Shedding tears
When her son finally ask that questions
Where my daddy at?
Mama, Why we live so poor?
Why you crying?
Heard you late night
Through my bedroom door
Now do you love me mama?
Why do they keep calling me nigger?
Get my weight up, with my hate
and pay 'em back when I'm bigger
Still thugging in this jail cell
Missing my block
Hearing brothers screaming all night
Wishing they'd stop
Proud to be black
But why do we act like
We don't love ourselves
Don't look around
buster (you sucker)
Check yourselves
know what if means to be black
whether a man or girl
we're still struggling in this
White man's world

(we must fight)
Who knows what tommorrow brings
In this world where everyone lies
Where to go
No matter how far I find
To let you know
That You're not alone

So tell me why you changed
Choosing new direction
In a blink of an eye
My time away just made perfection
You think I'd die
Not gonna cry
Why should I care
Like we holding on to lost love
That's no longer there
Can you please help me
God Bless me please
Keep my seeds healthy
Banging on my enemies Bleed
While my G's wealthy
Hoping they bury me
With ammunition, weed, and shells
Just in case they trip in heaven
Ain't no G's hell
Sister sorry for the pain
That I caused your heart
I know I'll change
If you help me
But Don't fall apart
Rest In Peace
To Latasha, Little Yummy, and Kato
To much for this cold world to take
Ended up being fatal

Even my hood call me baby Malcolm X with the tek's

I've got a brother don't rest
And he keep some drugs on him
Always in grind mood
Hustle to find food
Ever seen faces of death
That's what my nine do

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I was so money orientated, initiated as a thug
Fiendin' for wicked adventures, ambitious as I was
Picture a nigga on the verge of livin' insane
I sold my soul for a chance to kick it and bang
Now tell me if I'm wrong
But sayin' ""fuck the world"" got you deeper in my songs
Drinkin' 'til I hurl, spendin' money 'til it's gone
It's the good life, maybe niggas got it goin' on
Now maybe if I died, and came back, wouldn't have to slang crack
Addicted to the game, so obviously we came strapped
Please forgive me for my wicked ways, fuck a bitch
Bad Boy niggas eat a dick a day, bumpin' this
Lord have mercy, it's a slaughter
So wicked that my tracks is wettin' niggas like it's water
I learned my lessons as a thug in these wicked ass hood fights
But I'm a baller now, nigga, I live the good life

[Chorus: 2Pac]
This is the good life, fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggas that trust the hoes
Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
And live the good life, 'cause thug niggas don't die
See, we live the good life, fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggas that trust these hoes
Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise

I swear these playa haters done got a taste of power
It ain't all good in the hood
Least not on my side, from where I stand
And the law? Man, fuck the law!
Niggaz must outthink, outstep, and continuously outsmart
the motherfuckin law, in every way

To my niggaz run the streets, fuck peace) -- [repeat in background]
Heyyy niggaz, where your heart at?
See motherfuckers killin babies, killin mommas
Killin kids, puttin this in they motherfuckin mark
Now what type of mixed up trick would kill the future of our race
before he would he look his enemy dead in the eye, and open fire?
These crazy motherfuckers got toys with guns
Jails for guns, but still, no god damn jobs
And they wonder why we loc'n up
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go?

We stood together in April of ninety-two
With duty, and a sense of honor
There is no limit to what WE can achieve
That's all on us... us...
Not my niggaz, not the whites, not the enemies
or none of them motherfuckers, US
What can WE do? Shit
I declare a death sentence to all child molestors
Fake-ass bitches, male and female
And all you punk-ass snitches
We can do without your asshole

Are you afraid to die, or do you wanna live forever
Tell me, which one?

They wanna bury me, I'm worried -- I'm losin my mind
Look down the barrel of my nine and my vision's blurry
Fallin to pieces, am I guilty? I pray to the Lord
but he ignores me unfortunately cause I'm guilty
Show me a miracle, I'm hopeless -- I'm chokin off
marijuana smoke, with every toke it's like I'm losin focus
Fallin to sleep while I'm at service, when will I die?
Forever paranoid and nervous because I'm high
Don't mention funerals I'm stressin, and goin nutty
And reminiscin bout them niggaz that murdered my buddy
I wonder when will I be happy, ain't nothin funny
Flashbacks of bustin caps, anything for money
Where am I goin I discovered, can't nothin save me
My next door neighbor's havin convo with undercovers
Put a surprise in the mailbox, hope she get it
Happy birthday bitch, you know you shouldn'ta did it
Everybody's dyin am I next, who can I trust?
Will they be G's, and they look at me before they bust?
Or will they kill me while I'm sleepin, two to the head
while I'm in bed, leakin blood on my satin sheets
Is there a heaven for a baller? I'm gettin suspicious
of this bitch the line busy everytime I call her
Now she's tellin me to visit, who else is home?
I check the house before I bone, so we all alone
After I nut I hit the highway, see ya later
To all the players watch the fly way a nigga played her
The bitch is tellin all her homies -- that I can fuck her
like no other now them other bitches wanna bone me
I'm under pressure gettin drunk, somebody help me
I drink a fifth of Hennesey I don't think it's healthy
I see my enemies they creepin, don't make me blast
I watch the five-oh's roll, the motherfuckers pass
by me like they know me, smilin as they laugh
I put up my middle finger then I dash
Niggaz don't like me cause I'm Thuggin, and every day
I'm a hustler lookin to get paid

They wanna bury me, I'm worried -- no need to lie
I pray to God I don't scream when it's time to fry
Nowhere to rest I'm losin homies, ain't that a bitch
When I was rich I had clout, now a nigga's lonely
I put the pistol to my head, and say a prayer
I see visions of me dead, Lord are you there?
Then tell me am I lost cause I'm lonely
I thought I had friends but in the end a nigga dies lonely
Nowhere to run I'm in terror, and no one cares
A closed casket at my funeral and no one's there
Is there a future for a killer? I change my ways
But still that don't promise me the next day
So I stay Thuggin with a passion, forever blastin
I'm bustin on these motherfuckers in my madness
They wonder if I'm hellbound... well Hell
can't be worse than this, cause I'm in Hell now
Don't make me hurt you I don't want to, but I will
Seen motherfuckers killed over phone bills
Never will I die, I'll be back
Reincarnated as a motherfuckin mack
I love it cause in heaven there's no shortage on G's

and all other lil' young niggaz that's in a rush to be gangstas

As a young nigga, I'm almost swellin in the wind
Give anythang, to be that innocent again, when I was ten
I didn't bang but I was hangin with the homies
tell them niggaz started slangin that they don't know me
I got my hustle on, learned to ignore what couldn't pay me
Lately I've been tryin to make a bill-ion, can you play me
with that jealousy they need to miss me, don't sweat me
If them cowards really want me, come get me, and even I
someday will die but I'm cautious, I'm fin' to ride
Put down the top, now we flossin
Hit the freeway, let the wind blow, drop the window
Workin with a twenty sack of indo, feelin good
Stop through the hood, grab the young thugs
And I can't help but reminisce back when we slung drugs, know it's bad
but all we had was our hopes and dreams
Couldn't see unless we learned to slang dope to fiends
as young niggaz

He's the kind of G like everybody knows
As a young nigga
He's always G'd up, from head to toe
My memories as a young nigga
Always got it blown like Al Capone
Young nigga
He's the downest G I've ever known

Back in Junior High, when we was barely gettin by, when daddy died
That's when my momma started gettin high
My neighborhood was full of drivebys, couldn't survive
All our homies livin short lives, I couldn't cry
Told my momma if I did die, just put a blunt in my casket
let me get my dead homies high
Come follow me throughout my history, it's just
Me Against the World stuck in misery; as a young nigga
My only thing was to be paid
Life full of riches avoid snitched cause they shady, back in the days
We always found the time to play,
but that's before they taught them gangbangers how to spray
Not just L.A., but in the Bay and in Chicago and even St. Louis
Every stadium that I go, when will they change?
Stuck in the game like a dumb nigga
Remember how it was, to be a young nigga

He's the kind of G like everybody knows
As a young nigga
He's always G'd up, from head to toe
My memories as a young nigga
Always got it blown like Al Capone
Young nigga
He's the downest G I've ever known

I'm tellin you.
. to be young, have your brains and have every? and all that
Yo, y'all niggaz don't know how good you really do got it
Muh'fuckers need to just calm down
and peep what the fuck they wanna do for the rest of the life
'Fore you end your life before you BEGIN your life
You dumb nigga

Now that I'm grown, I got my mind on bein somethin
Don't wanna be another statistic, out here doin nuttin
Tryin to maintain in this dirty game, keep it real
and I will even if it kills me, my young niggaz
break away from these dumb niggaz
Put down the guns and have some fun nigga, the rest'll come nigga
Fame is a fast thang, that gangbangin
puttin niggaz in a casket, murdered for hangin
at the wrong place at the wrong time, no longer livin
Cause he threw up the wrong sign, and every day
I watch the murder rate increases, and even worse
the epidemic and diseases, what is the future?
The projects lookin hopeless, where
more and more brothers givin up and don't care
Sometimes I hate when brothers act up, I hit the weed
and I proceed to blow the track up, for young niggaz

He's the kind of G like everybody knows
For these young niggaz
He's always G'd up, from head to toe
My memories as a young nigga
He always got it blown like Al Capone
Take it slow nigga, it's for the young niggaz
He's the downest G I've ever known
As a young nigga

He's the kind of G like everybody knows
He's always G'd up, from head to toe
Memories as a young nigga
He always got it blown like Al Capone

Look here Miss Thang
hate to salt your game
but yous a money hungry woman
and you need to change.

In tha locker room
all the homies do is laugh.
High five's cuz anotha nigga
played your ass.

It was said you were sleeezy
even easy
sleepin around for what
you need

See it's your thang
and you can shake it how you wanna.
Give it up free
or make your money on the corner.

But don't be bad and play the game
get mad and change.
Then you wonda why these muthafuckas
call you names.

Still lookin' for a way out
and that's OK
I can see you wanna stray
there's a way out.

Keep your mind on your money,
enroll in school.
And as the years pass by
you can show them fools.

But you ain't tryin' to hear me
cuz your stuck,
you're headin' for the bathroom
'bout to get tossed up.

Still lookin' for a rich man
you dug a ditch,
got your legs up
tryin' to get rich.

I love you like a sista
but you need to switch
and that's why they called
U bitch, I betcha.

You leave your kids with your mama
cuz your headin' for the club
in a skin tight miniskirt
lookin' for some love.

Got them legs wide open
while you're sittin' at the bar
Talkin' to some nigga
'bout his car.

I guess he said he
had a Lexxxus, what's next?
You headin' to his car for some sex

I pass by
can't hold back tears inside
cuz, lord knows
for years I tried.

And all the other people
on my block hate your guts
Then you wonda why they stare
and call you slut.

It's like your mind don't understand
you don't have to kill your
dreams ploten'
schemes on a man

Keep your head up, legs closed, eyes open
either a nigga wear a rubber or he die smokin'
I'm hearin' rumors so you need to switch
and niggas wouldn't call you bitch, I betcha.

[Verse Three: 2Pac]

I guess times gettin' hard
even harder for you
cuz, hey now, got a baby
on the way now

More money from the county
and thanks to the welfare
you're about to
get your hair done.

Got a dinner date
can't be late
trick or treat, sweet thang
got anotha trick to meet.

The way he did it
it was smooth
plottin' while he gamin' you
So baby, peep tha rules.

I shoulda seen it in the first case
the worst case
I shoulda never called you back
in the first place.

I remember back in high school
baby you was fast
straight sex
and barely move your ass.

But now things change
cuz you don't look the same
let the ghetto get the best of you
baby, that's a shame

Caught HIV and now you 'bout to be deceased
and finally be in peace.

So where your niggas at now
cuz everybody left
they stepped
and left you on your own

See I loved you like a sista
but you died to quick
And that's why we called U bitch, I betcha.

Times goes on, and everybody grows
Grew apart, had to part, went our own ways

In many ways we were paid in the old days

In fact I travel the map with raps that spray cats
But now I don't wanna down my homie

But I guess that the streets is harder
Trying to survive in the life of a young godfather
My homies is making it elsewhere
Striving, working nine to five with no health care
We both had dreams of being great
But his deferred, and blurred and changed in shaped
It's fate, it wasn't my choice to make
To be great, I'm giving it all it takes
Trying to shake, the crates and fakes and snakes
I gotta take, my place or fall from grace
The foolish way, the pace is quick and great
Smiling face, to hide the trace of hate

Cause both black and white are smokin crack tonight
And only time we deal is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And though it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black President, huh
It ain't a secret don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
I wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living should I blast myself
I'm tired of being poor and even worse I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm lookin for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a ne-gro
Pull a trigger kill a nigger he's a hero
Mo' nigga mo' nigga mo' niggaz
I'd rather be dead than a po' nigga
Let the Lord judge the criminals
If I die, I wonder if heaven got a ghetto

[Chorus (to :27 from fade)]

Just think, if niggaz decide to retaliate
(Soldier in the house)
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto [4X to fade]",2166117

[guy] 
Don't be callin my woman no bitch! I'll fuck you up!
[guard] 
Yeah yeah fool, what? Yeah yeah that's what they all say fool.
You institutionalized, and this is your home...

Guess who's back, and ready to knock off a cop or two
Cause me and the crew could still get our rocks off
The penetentiary don't stop a nigga cause he's in jail
Hell I'm makin more money on the street from here in a cell
I'm livin proper, the coppers is havin fits
I just made the profit, you punks ain't stoppin shit
I still remember my momma told me
Find the cop who killed your brother
send him to Hell lookin homely
Cause a real nigga love the law
What's raw is a nigga that's above the law
Keep pressin your luck and get fucked, huh
Think a nigga don't know whassup cause he's locked up
But in the meantime, it's get swoll get clean time
Concentrate on gettin green time
And as the years go by, they forgot
about the small time soldier from the block, huh
To kill the crook they threw the book at me
Don't worry be nappy, don't even look happy
Put me in the hole, gave me cold cuts
Did push-ups until I swoll up
And then they offer me a furlough
But what they don't know as soon as I get free I'm killin five mo'
They asked me if I changed much
I told em 'Yeah' even though I'm still the same nut
They started askin my questions about my brother
And makin remarks about my mother, hmm
Wait a minute, hold up
Makin jokes about my folks'll get yours blown up
They sent me back to the hole for what I told em
I guess he didn't believe me, so I showed him
He went home to find a tragedy
Nigga, that's what you get for tryin to badger me
And anybody else that wanna sweat me
I'm already in jail so you punks can't get me
You better pray they never see me
Cause if they let me free, prepare for trouble on the streets.

When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me

I heard a snicker a laugh, I take a look at the evening news
And see a nigga gettin cuffed by the boys in blue
Is it a, frame up, tryin to keep me out the game, stuck
These motherfuckers tryin to dirty up my name, but
I slip as quick as the wind, it's me again, fuck friends
My foes be on a mission, tryin to do me in
Fuck em I'm out to get out, they all thought
I blow up like gauge, and in a rage blow they balls off
Why are you niggaz tryin to test me trick?
And be the first ones to snitch to arrest me bitch
Maintain with a nigga meal ticket only if you with the real
The nigga will kick it, I'll enforce it with the steel
These are lessons that I learned in jail
Rule one: fuck a busta he can burn in Hell
Now I'm workin with connects that I got in the pen
In no time I'll be clockin again

[Chorus]

Heyyy, still sittin in my cell as I dwell on my past
Tryin to figure how a nigga turned dreams into cash
Quick call her collect, ain't no respect on the other side
My cellmate's suicidal cause his mother died
And my C.O. is a lady, and I'm thinkin maybe
me and her can hook up a scheme, to be Swayze
Cause she keep on callin me baby, to a young
motherfucker facin eighty that's enough to make me crazy
Now how long will it take, to get a hook
Got her watchin me liftin weights, sneakin looks
I devised a plan, I'm in the trunk while she drives
but man, ain't no disguise I'ma die as a man
If we make it then I'm takin it to Hell
all them niggaz that was frontin while I sat up in a cell
Locked in jail, I couldn't touch her so I planned, in misery
The nigga you don't wanna see

[Chorus 3X]

When I get free, believe that shit
Yeah nigga fuck your cigarette, fuck that phone call motherfucker
I'll be out this motherfucker in a few days
I'll pay these bitches back in spades

Leaving 'em niggas head's blown, cause they know they dead wrong

Talk a lot with your mouth, well what you gon' do? (So what you gon' do?)
Shut 'em down, busters be knowing to keep they distance
Thugs don't fuck around
We get back at 'em so swiftly, niggas is with me underground

Mash up on the gas pedal
Vacate the scene
Count the cash and stash the precious metal
Here come the coppers

Them crackers is crazy
Why? Cause they'll never stop us

Now I want to do it too

I gotta tell mom, before she sees me
I told her how he g'd me, and she didn't believe me
Callin me a slut cuz my butt's kinda big so
Still that ain't no way to be talkin to your kids though

Crack done took apart of our family tree
my momma's on tha shit, my dadies splitten, mom's steady blaming me
is it my fault, just cause i'm a young black male
cop sweat me as if my destiny is makin' crack sells
only 15 and got problems
cops on my tail, so I bail till I dodge 'em
they finally pull me over and I laugh
remember Rodney King and I blast on his punk ass
now I gotta murder case
you speak a' Heaven punk, I never heard of tha place
what is it ta come up fast, got a Uz and a black mask
drop tha fuckin task, now who's tha jack ass
keep my shit cocked, cause tha cops got a glock too
what tha fuck would you do
drop them or let 'em drop you
I chose droppin' tha cop
I got me a glock, and a glock for tha niggas on my block
4 of'em tried ta stab me, I moved out
sold a pound a weed, made g's, bought a new house
i'm only 17, I'm tha new kid
I got me a crew, bought'em jewels, and a uzi
but all good things don't last
task came fast, and busted my black ass
coolen in tha pen, where tha goods kept
now my little brother wants ta follow in my footsteps
a soulja

Chorus
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me

All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me

Buck, buck, pigs get fucked, don't step ta this
Quiet has kept them blessed, on a quest with a death wish
Tell 'em they come and test, and tha rest, nigga gets hectic
Here's tha aneirexic, i'm making it to an exit
Walkin' through tha streets on tha black tip
Packed with several gats, cause i'm also payin' back shit
Niggas don't wanna try me, brotha you'll get shot down
Now i'm kick'en tha block, cause my bigger brothers locked down
I'm hot now, so many punk police have got shot down
Other cops see me on tha block, and they jock now
That's what I call a kingpin
Send my brotha what he needs is some weed up ta season
Tell him just be ready set, pack ya shit up quick
And when I hit, be prepared ta jet
Niggas from tha block on tha boat now
Every single one got a gun, that'll smoke pow
These punks about ta get hit by tha best
I'm wear'en double vest, so aim at my fuckin chest
I'll be makin' straight dome calls
Touch tha button on tha wall, you'll be picken up your own balls
I can still hear my mother shout, hit tha pig nigga
Break your bigga brother out
I got a message for tha warden
I'm commin' for ya ass, as fast as Flash Gorden
We get surrounded in tha mess hall, yes ya'll
A crazy motherfucka makin' death calls
Just bring me my brother and we leavin
For every minute you stall, one ya'll bleedin'
They brought my brother in a jiffy
I took a cop, just in case things got tricky
And just as we was walken out, I caught a bullet in tha head
Tha screams never left my mouth
My brother caught a bullet too
I think he gonna pull through, he deserve to
Tha fast life ain't everything they told ya
Never get much older, following tha tracks of a soulja

I try to effect by kicking the facts
and stacking much mail
I'm packing a gat cuz guys wanna jack
and fuck goin to jail
Cuz I ain't equipped to stop how I look
I don't sell ya-yo
They teachin a brother like I was in books
Follow me into a flow
I'm sure you know, which way to go
I'm hittin em out of the dopes
So slip on the slope, let's skip on the flow
I'm fuckin the sluts and hoes
The bigger the butts the tighter the clothes
The gimminy jimminy grows
Then whaddya know, it's off with some clothes
Rowd when the crowd says hoe
That let's me know, they know I can flow
Love when they come to my shows
I get up and go, with skins before
When I'm collecting my dough
I never respect, the one that I back
The quicker the nigga can rap
The bigger the check, now watch how they sweat
What kind of style is that?
The style of a mack, and ready to jack
I rendered up piles of black
The wacker the pack, the fatter the smack
I hate it when real nigga bust
They hate when I cuss, they threaten to bust
I had enough of the fuss
I bust what I bust, and cuss when I must
They gave me a charge for sales
For selling the tales... of young black males

Yes nigga, N-I-G-G-A niggaz

Ay nigga you can't handle that shit!
Pass that man!

Hit that shit, that's the shit!

Hands on my semi-

It's a trap a long maze
Dreamin' of gettin' stacks
Makin' scratch the wrong way

Black out blow the crack out

I inhale strong weed then release the stress
Deliver the bomb shit from the east to west

So I just stop listenin' and now my cash is up

They just instigate and as soon as the get the tape
It's dropped from my nigga life just as soon as they get the case

Just 'cause I refuse to be silent
These hypocrites are havin fits
'Cause I'm not buyin' it, defyin' it

Envious because I will rebel against any oppressor
And this is known as self defense
I show no mercy, they claim that I'm the lunatic
But when the shit gets thick, I'm the one you go and get

Don't look confused, the truth is so plain to see
'Cause I'm the nigga that you sell-outs are ashamed to be
In every jeep and every car, brothers stomp this
I'm never ignorant, getting goals accomplished

The underground railroad on an uprise
This time the truth's gettin' told, heard enough lies
I told em fight back, attack on society
If this is violence, then violent's what I gotta be

If you investigate you'll find out where it's comin' from
Look through our history, America's the violent one
Unlock my brain, break the chains of your misery
This time the payback for evil shit you did to me

They call me militant, racist cause I will resist
You wanna censor somethin', motherfucker censor this
My words are weapons, and I'm steppin' to the silent
Wakin' up the masses, but you claim that I'm violent

They claimin' that I'm violent, cut and scratched
Fuck the damn cop, cut and scratched
Just because we play what the people want
They claimin' that I'm violent, cut and scratched

Fuck the damn cop, cut and scratched
Just because we play what the people want
They claimin' that I'm violent, cut and scratched
Fuck the damn cop, cut and scratched

The cops can't stand me, but they can't touch me
Call me a dope man, cause I rock dope beats
Jacked by the police, didn't have my ID
I said, ""Excuse me, why you tryin to rob me?""

He had tha nerve to say that I had a curfew
Do you know what time it is?
Get out the fucking car, or I'll hurt you
""Get out the car or I'lI hurt you""

So here I go, I better make my mind up
Pick my nine up or hit the line-up
I chose B, stepped into the streets
The first cop grabbed me, the other ripped my seat

They grabbed my homie and they threw him to the concrete
Ay man, aiyo, ay man just c'mon
""What you doin' man?"", They tried to frame me
They tried to say I had some dope in the back seat

But I'm a rap fiend, not a crack fiend
My homie panicked, ""I'm out"", he tried to run
Freeze nigga, I heard a bullet fire from the cop's gun
My homie dropped so, I hit the cop

I kept swingin', yo, I couldn't stop
Before I knew it, I was beatin' the cop senseless
The other cop dropped his gun, he was defenseless
Argh, fuck you

Now I'm against this cop who was racist
Given him a taste of tradin' places
And all this, cause the peckerwood was tryin' this
Frame up, but I came up, now they claimin' that I'm violent

As I was beatin' on a cop, I heard a gun click, uh-ohh
Then the gun shot, but I wasn't hit
I turned around it was my homie with the gun in hand
He shot the cop damn, now he's a dead man

I said, come on, it's time for us to get away
Let's go, we gotta get the fuck outta here
They called for backup, and they'll be on their way
Jumped in the car, and tried to get away quick

The car wouldn't start, damn, we in deep shit
So we jumped out, c'mon let's take the cop's car
We drove a little ways thinkin' that we got far
But I looked up and all I saw was blue lights
If I die tonight, I'm dying in a gunfight
I grabbed the AK, my homie took the 12 gauge
Load em up quick, it's time for us to spray
We'll shoot em up with they own fuckin weapons
And when we through sprayin' Audi, then we steppin'
This is a lesson to the rednecks and crooked cops
You fuck with real niggaz, get ya fuckin' ass dropped
So here we go, the police against us
Dark as dusk, waitin' for the guns to bust, what's next man?
What's next, I don't know and I don't care
One things fo' sho' tomorrow I won't be here
But if I go, I'm takin' all these punks with me

Trying to pay me debt for all my sins

I'm living in hell, stuck in my jail cell

Waiting for my chance to post bail

So I'm dumping on cowards crazy when ever faded
I know I said it all before but now I mean it

Plus I never had to worry 'bout a visit, cause your're there daily
Guard trying to get your number, you don't dare tell me
Tongue kissing, steady humping
Trying to touch up something
Before the C-O in the corner jump in, frontin'
Late night reminiscing, everybody's quiet
I think something's in the air, prepare for the riot
It's padlocks in my socks, steel from the bed springs, I touch 'em with thug love
And then let they heads ring
I started a war, but now I'm gone
Release me to the streets in the morning, it's on
Soon as I get home

Grab my straps, locate my comrades
Let's get my enemies not knowing I'm coming back
Go get the money out the safe
It's time to turn the streets into a war zone
Soon as I get home

So keep it going
My whole life's been like a game of Cee-low
Thinking big like they keep to me no feelings my dreams like Nino
Brown the whole town be shook up
And me and momma survived the pick up
How many rocks I made to cook up
Narcotics got traffic, seen those niggas you blasted
Wanting me in a casket, on a ground, kind of plastic
Yeah nigga I heard you, Lil' Mu gave the word
You get paroled on the 3rd, you sold love, we out here fronting
Still here but all about nothing, but double O's is
What I'm wanting, and I'm trying to see something
That we ain't never had
Luxury life, results living bad
Tricks of the trade
Shit that should've been taught by dad
But learn, do the crew, lessons between me and you
And once we lock this shit down it ain't a thing they can do
Meanwhile I stay waiting by the phone
Hoping I'll get a call telling a nigga that you home

Grab my straps, locate my comrades
Let's get my enemies not knowing I'm coming back
Go get the money out the safe
It's time to turn the streets into a war zone
Soon as I get home

Grab my straps, locate my comrades
Let's get my enemies not knowing I'm coming back
Go get the money out the safe
It's time to turn the streets into a war zone
Soon as I get home

Grab my straps, locate my comrades
Let's get my enemies not knowing I'm coming back
Go get the money out the safe
It's time to turn the streets into a war zone

Let's get my enemies not knowing I'm coming back
Go get the money out the safe

Heh, so?
You say that like that means somethin to me
You've been gone a mighty long motherfuckin time
for you to be comin home talkin that ""daddy's home"" shit (nigga)
We been gettin along fine just without you
Me, my brother, and my mother
So if you don't mind, you can step the FUCK off, POPS. fuck you!

Had to play catch by myself, what a sorry sight
A pitiful plight, so I pray for a starry night
Please send me a pops before puberty
the things I wouldn't do to see a piece of family unity
Moms always work, I barely see her
I'm startin to get worried without a pops I'll grow to be her
It's a wonder they don't understand kids today
so when I pray, I pray I'll never grow to be that way
And I hope that he answers me
I heard God don't like ugly well take a look at my family
A different father every weekend
Before we get to meet him they break up before the week ends
I'm gettin sick of all the friendships
As soon as we kick it he done split and the whole shit ends quick
How can I be a man if there's no role model?
Strivin to save my soul I stay cold drinkin a forty bottle
I'm so sorry...

I'm so sorry
for all this time (I'm so sorry)
for all this time
for all this time (don't lie)
I'm so sorry
for all this time (so, sorry)
for all this time
for all this time, so sorry baby!

Moms had to entertain many men
Didn't wanna do it but it's time to pay the rent again
I'm gettin a bit older and I'm startin to be a bother
Moms can't stand me cause I'm lookin like my father
Should I stay or run away, tell me the answer
Moms ignores me and avoids me like cancer
Grow up rough and it's hard to understand stuff
Moms was tough cause his poppa wasn't man enough
Couldn't stand up to his own responsibilities
Instead of takin care of me, he'd rather live lavishly
That's why I'll never be a father;
unless you got the time it's a crime don't even bother
(That's when I started hatin the phony smiles
Said I was an only child)
Look at mama's lonely smile
It's hard for a son to see his mother cry
She only loves you, but has to fuck with these other guys
I'm so sorry...

I'm so sorry
for all this time
for all this time
for all this time
I'm so sorry
for all this time
for all this time (so sorry)
for all this time, so sorry baby!

Man child in the promised land couldn't afford many heroes
Moms was the only one there my pops was a no-show
And ohh -I guess ya didn't know
that I would grow to be so strong
Lookin kinda pale, was it the ale oh pops was wrong
Where was the money that you said, you would send me
talked on the phone and you sounded so friendly
Ask about school and my welfare
but it's clear, you ain't sincere hey who the hell cares
You think I'm blind but this time I see you comin, Jack
You grabbed your coat, left us broke, now ain't no runnin back
Ask about my moms like you loved her from the start
Left her in the dark, she fell apart from a broken heart
So don't even start with that ""wanna be your father"" shit
Don't even bother with your dollars I don't need it
I'll bury moms like you left me all alone G
Now that that I finally found you, stay the Fuck away from me
You're so sorry.

I'm so sorry (so sorry)
for all this time (so, so sorry)
for all this time (I'm so so sorry)
for all this time (fuck that!)
I'm so sorry
for all this time (no)
for all this time (so sorry)
for all this time, so sorry baby!

I never meant to leave but I was wanted
Crossed too many people every house I'd touch was haunted
Had to watch the strangers every brother was in danger
If I was to keep you breathin, had to be out of range-a
Had to move, one to lost my name and pick the number
Made me watch my back I had no happy home to run to
Maybe it's my fault for being a father livin fast
But livin slow, mean half the dough, and you won't get no ass
Hindsight shows me it was wrong all along
I wanted to make some dough so you would grow to be so strong
It took a little longer than I thought
I slipped, got caught, and sent to jail by the courts
Now I'm doin time and I wish you'd understand
all I ever wanted was for you to be a man
and grow to be the type you was meant to be
Keep the war fightin by the writings that you sent to me

Goddamn! Rap music I hate that
It's just so violent and it destroys everyone, it makes the kids crazy
The kids kill people
There cop hater
here going against society, I don't understand the music
It's too loud, it's too rowdy, it's too violent
Let's ban all rap music
(Outlaws)
Ban Tupac, ban the Outlaw Immortals ban 'em

[Verse One: Young Noble]
Listen it ain't no stopping
I gotta hustle
Cop it make it double, try to
Stop it and touch it, I'm gonna cock it and bust it
Niggaz tryna get it addicted to fast living
Get rich or die trying nigga as 50
I've been Operating Under Thug Laws As A Warrior
Oppressed by the industry the Hip-Hop government
Watched and harassed by the Hip-Hop Police
Why you think Nas screaming Hip-Hop deceased?
No justice (No justice)
All the judges got grudges
Giving my niggaz life for a little next to nothing
So wherever you are, just a little extra something
You ain't the only one, we all going through the struggle
Penny pinching
It's like you really ain't living
? until eleven's, I'm cooking in the kitchen
Like we looking and we wishing
Praying will he hear it?
It's eating at my spirit
Speaking for the spirits

[Verse Two: Tupac]
You can't break me
Never make me
Buster soft the beats
This Outlaw style got a brother off the streets
Miss Deloris Tucker sue me I won't stop
Till we get justice for these crooked cops on my block
Time Warner full of sissies
Tell 'em all to miss me
A bunch of hypocrites
Whistling Dixie
Good riddance cause you never should of touched me
You cowards knew you couldn't take the pressure I'm gonna make you sorry
Trust me
Didn't cry when they dropped me
(Nah)
Can they stop me?
Tryna sell 4 million copies
If I wasn't spitting it'd be prison or death
This rap game all we got left
So try to comprehend where we coming from
Life as an Outlaw
Ain't meant for everyone
So here we come
Recognize how we organize
Strategies now we unified brothers on the rise
And we can't stop

[Chorus: Young Noble & Stormy]
No way no how we got to keep moving
And putting it down
We can't stop
(Outlaws)
Until we reach the top
Through the music we speak to the blocks
Believe it or not
I don't know what you've been, told
Real niggaz don't stay on they go
Can't stop until I get that you know
Won't stop until I get that keep going

[Verse Three: Hussein Fatal]
Bury me with a Makaveli suit and a Mac
I've God strike me with lightning, I'm shooting him back
Skinny cause I don't work out, my man is in the gym
Long as I'm strong enough to put a hammer on your chin
Trapped in the storm
Fuck the world till I'm gone
I'm bucking at Corey Brooke he treating my niggaz wrong
Until I'm gone
They gon' see who I be
I picture this bricks ducking from the penitentiary

[Verse Four: Kadafi]
See
Mysteriously it seems
Through my deepest thoughts and dreams its all wrong
Pop too long gone, and now 18 I'm stranded on my own
Abandoned here in the zone
Protect my thrown pal like a king, Al Capone style
Fake no jacks on this grind
Coked up with crack I get mine
Living life as a Don, Guess Gortex, Louis Vuitton

[Verse Five: Hussein Fatal]
Yeah your boys back with the proper team
When they think I'm wearing Red I'm gonna rock the Green
On a whole 'nother episode
Cops never heard of ya
The otherside'll hide down the block from the murder scene
Catch ya man he dead with the Fifth
When it's hot on Nu he G-Ride from the clear to the bricks
So gangster how he switched from the clear to the bricks
Niggaz hate it but they scared of the Fifth

(And we won't stop)
Outlaws!

[Verse Six: Big Syke]
This rap game like a robbery
Cause it seem somebody hiding me
My nigga, made a motherfucker cop a Ki'
Motherfucker ain't no stopping me
My nigga, It's Mussolini see me all in the midst
I'm still chilling like I'm bottle of Crys'
Enemies sharpen they ?
And when they see me they can give me a kiss
So I'm posing with the frozen wrists
Outlaw immortalized we survived and cursed
So I claim it like I'm bangin a turf
Yeah it's easy like I'm putting in work
Not been easy you wanna jerk
Come the squeeze I'm ready to murk
Outlaws, Makaveli niggaz ready to flow
So baby are you ready to go?
Outlaw my niggaz be screaming at night
A Big Syko with the thug in your life

Don't stop (Don't stop)
Keep going (Keep going)
Even when the wheels fall off we keep rolling (Keep rolling)
This Hip-Hop thing just won't stop
It's number one at the top of the charts
Here to stay like 'Pac
Man I just can't let it go
It's in my blood stream (Yeah)
So when I flow, I gotta do my thug thing
For the hood the under privileged and oppressed
Young nigga get rich, cash more cheques
Take the hood life
Put it on on wax
Get stakes now we living the good life
Car brand new and it shine so clean
Bought momma a house, on sweet sixteen's
And we, sitting clean in the latest edition
From the block to the movie screen deep in and pimpin'

You claimin' I'ma criminal when you the one that made me
They got me trapped in this slavery
Now I'm lost in this holocaust headin for my grave, G
I told Sam, he could fuck the war
And got a busted jaw for sayin', ""Fuck the law""
And if you wonder why I'm mad, check the record
What's a nigga gotta do to get respected?

Sometimes I think I'm getting tested
And if I don't say, ""Yes"" a nigga quick to get arrested
That's the reason I stay zestin'
I keep a vest on my chest incase the cops is getting restless
Walkin' 'round ready to light shit up
And since my life is fucked, some say I'm slightly nuts
Buck, buck is the sound as I move up
Other niggas pay attention when a fool bust

They make a nigga be a killer
I used to be a dealer but they wanted to see who's realer
Now them same motherfuckas wanna murder me
And I wonder if the Lord ever heard of me
I need loot, so I'm doin' what I do
And don't say shit until you've walked in my shoes

My little boy gotta eat too
So why must I sock a fella? Just live large like Rocafella
And did you ever stop to think? I'm old enough to go to war
But I ain't old enough to drink
Cops wanna hit me with the book, and you're hooked on my
'I don't give a fuck look

Makin' rules, I'ma break 'em, no matter how much you make 'em
You show me bacon, I'ma take 'em
So don't you ever tempt me, I'm a fool for mine, nigga
And my pockets stay empty
To my brother in the barrio
You're livin' worse then the niggas in ghetto so
I give a fuck about your language or complexion
You got love for the niggas in my section

You got problems with the punk police
Don't run from the chumps, get the pump from me
We ain't free, I'll be damned if I played a chip
For a blond haired, blue eyed Caucasian bitch
Down with my home boy, rich
Fuck a snitch and groupie ass bitch
And a nigga with a cellular phone
Leave his baby at home so he can go out and bone
And you wonder why we blazin' niggas
'Cause you punks havin' babies can't raise the niggas
And they damned to be fuck ups too

And little boys playin stick ball, quick y'all
Get out the street before they hit y'all

And wonder how we came to this
I help an old lady across the street, the cost is free
I can't take what she offers me
And this is how the world could be
This is how the world should be

Feels good to be back on the streets

Cause I know they got love for me, nuttin but love

When I was young I used to want to be a dealer see

Cause the gold and cars they appealed to me
I saw our brothers getting rich slangin crack to folks
And the square's getting big for these sack of dope
Started thinking bout a plan to get paid myself
So I made myself, raised myself
Til the dealer on the block told me, ""That ain't cool
You ain't meant to slang crack, you a rapper fool""
I got my game about women from a prostitute
And way back used to rap on the block for loot
I tryed to make my way legit, haha
But it was hard, cause rhymes don't pay the rent
And uhh, it was funny how I copped out
I couldn't make it in school, so finally I dropped out
My family on welfare
I'm steady thinking, since don't nobody else care
I'm out here on my own
At least in jail I have a meal and I wouldn't be alone
I'm feelin like a waste, tears rollin down my face
Cause my life is filled with hate

Here we go

Lord help me, save me, Mama keep praying
For a young motherfucker trying to duck an early grave
In the city where ya can't tell the snakes from the fakes
Fakes from the phonies, enemies of homies
Around the corner there's another nigga waiting to jack
He don't know I got a glock 'til his ass get shot
Like a motherfucking thug disease
Craving beats like they motherfucking drugs to me, hey
What's up with bitches trying to screw me? Do me cause I did a movie
Throw the pussy to me but before they never knew me
Rather die then let ya play me for a, buster
And with my glock I'm a plotting ass rotten motherfucker, huh
Don't let the movie fool ya, let me school ya
Screaming Thug Life nigga when I do ya
I'm going crazy, getting dizzy
And then I suffacate a motherfucking breather bring me back
I'm telling ya I'm losing it

[Chorus]
Said I'm losing my mind
Losing my mind

[Big Syke]
I'm going crazy, niggas can't fade me
On the real I kill when I step to ya fucking grill
So let me kick it let me flip it let me get wicked
I'm not a buster from the hood selling whooped tickets
I hang with G's flipping keys and smoking weed
I get the cash and dash and never learn to read
So fuck a bitch fuck a hoe and I let ya know
Because they come and go like the wind blows
What am I giving how I'm living what I'm giving up
You can take my life and I don't give a fuck
Cause I'm the trouble most coming from the west coast
Where the niggas is banging 'til the overdose
Killers and murderers, psychos and lunatics
Nobody knows what makes my mind click
Is it the demons, screaming inside of me?
Hell no it's just the Thug Life mentallity
I'm going crazy shit don't phase me
I'm living like a thug 'til six niggas carry me
Death is on the trigga so pull it
I can't take it no more, nigga, I'm losing it

Shit was talking to me, my gat screamed fire
The bullet told me shoot that motherfucker he's a lier
I talked to me 3-80 like a bitch on a stroll
When my niggas try to ????
Nigga, I can't get fucked in this game I'm a psychopath
My AK told me to shove him up some niggas ass
I'm having long conversations with Mr. Millometer
He's one of my best friends bitch ass nigga eater
And Miss Mossburg love it in the back trunk
You know that old school bitch she like to get it funked
And spitting motherfuckers by the seems
My grand daddy Mr. AR-15
By the evil motherfucker
Talked me into taking over a dope turf and shooting cluckers
Said he was my only family
Shoot straight, and please don't jam me
Got in a fight at the club my gat started talking
Told me to shut the fuck up and let him do the talking
I woke up and it was sick to see the guts hang
I'm going nuts man

Yeah, you got the Live Squad in this motherfucker
We got my nigga Treach from Naughty by Nature in this motherfucker
My nigga Apache up in this motherfucker

[Verse One: Tupac]

My Mossberg goes boom, gimme room, can I catch it
Talkin quick and then I vic just tryin to keep from gettin blasted
I had enough I put a hit upon them bastards
Boo-yaa!  Turned a snitch into a casket
Now they after me, prowling for a niggaz bucks
Time to see, who's the G, with the bigger nuts
Buck buck, big up and livin reckless
Niggaz with a death wish step in with a Tec and I'll wet this
Yeah this shit is hyper
Two to one I'm writing representing and I'm striking like a viper
Huh, I got my mind made up, I got my nine
Ring the alarm, and strong arm must run
Some niggaz need to feel me with a passion
I'm old fashioned, run up on me nigga and get blasted
With five deadly venomz

(Yeah 'Pac, fuck that, still hittin em up with
that old deadly shit.  Aiyyo Treach where you at?
Step up and hit they ass up with the wickedness.)

[Verse Two: Treach]

We come to hit you with a sock full of Brooklyn
to the Onyx of your nose, punk is funky like skunk blunts
Stunk like funk cunt
I come to take you on a war rough and rugged route
And if another doubts I blow your fuckin mother out
And that's the street scarred style
I shout I'm-de-MC-wit-de-nasty-mouf, and kick the bitch out
Sue me?  I pay the lawyer for ya oh boy yeah
Plus my style's ten to twenty fuckin pounds more
I take you quicker than a picture of a punk ya pickin shit
pickin pockets with a razor stoppin Russian rockets
Not shoplift, I'm liftin shop
Once you sound hot, cause if you ain't a perfect ten
my sign is stop!
It's twenty mother-crooked-fuckin styles in em
Like women I did em I'm in for deadly ready venom

[Verse Three: Live Squad]

Yeah, as I take a puff I get rough, Big Mad
To put it on, can't none come tougher see
I'm down with the sound of the Squad hard, boom!
Breakin em down, I make em see their doom
Coming straight from the dome where I roam it's a job to
rob and steal and runnin from the coppers
Who hold a, boulder, turn the gun controller
Started from a punk now to be a high roller
Youngest, reckless, crazy, disaster
Mac-11 blaster, and I run faster
Than a lot of cops I can't be stopped till my head gets popped
A lot of fuckin bodies will drop
It's a disaster, I'm coming for the blood splatter
I make you scatter, leavin trails of brains and bladders
Blowin em out the frame with no shame
Game tight, drop a body then get out of sight
Count my loot after I shoot, leave my kicks up and it's
something I don't wanna do, somethin that I never did
I try to get him, I think I hit em, I lit him
He's out!  A poison, a deadly venom

(Yeah Mad, fuck that!  You know how we do.
KnowhatI'msayin?  Squad in effect, YG'z in effect.
Now you know a nigga like me gotta represent)

[Verse Four: Live Squad]

Once again, back to rip shit, quick on the flip tip
The psycho, represent the real to take the mic flow
Deadly, rock a head G, check the melody
Niggaz can't touch me when I wreckin G you better flee
Cause I'm gifted with a jab and a forty-four Mag
So nigga flip or take a trip in a body bag
Uhh, boom you slipped up, now you're zipped up
Yeah one more statistic, fronted and got ripped up
No joke, you be yolk, no matter how it sound
We're taking over eight niggaz back to the stomping grounds
Line em up single file, dome runnin in em
A nigga hit em with the venom, the fourth deadly venom

(Nigga, yaknowhatI'msayin?  Fuck that!
I told you, we takin over, yo 'Pac.)

[Verse Five: 2Pac]

Five deadly venomz verse five be the livest
Strugglin and strive, keep a nine in my waistline
Take mine, you better bury me, G
Punk ass niggaz don't even worry me, see
I got a glock that say 'Pac run the block
Fuck the cops cause my gauge gets me... PAID
As I sit and reminesce about the old days
Hugging on my AK, fuck getting played, hey
I say niggaz need to get they mind right
Until they do I pop a clip and grip my nine tight
Now it's on everday could be my last day
That's why I blast on they ass as I past let the glass spray
First you had a mouth full of fronts
Now you're mouth's full of chunks, Pac's out puffin blunts
Deadly venomz

Throw up your middle finger!  Start the track for the maniac
Only thing I'm givin out is black donuts and dirty backs
Let me tell how you rough I get
I pop shit behind your back get in your face and pop the same shit
You can't get in because my gate's bigger I'ma snake nigga

No smiles on our faces, thirteen catchin cases

Driven by my own demons, cause they was killin me

Ain't nuthin' but anotha calculated scheme
To keep us locked up and shot up and back in chains
To deny us our future rob our name
Kept our history a mystery but now i see
The American dream wasn't meant for me
Cause lady liberty's a hypocrite she lied to me
Promised freedom education and ecuality
Never gave be nuthin' but slavery
But now look at how dangerous you made me
Callin' me a man cause I'm strong and bold
With this gumbo of knowledge of the lies you told
Promised me emancipation and a free nation
All you ever gave my people was starvation
The father of our country never cared for me
They kept our ancestors shacked up in slavery
Uncle Sam neva did a damm thing for me
Exept lie about the facts in my history
Now I'm sittin' here mad cause I'm unemployed
But the government mad cause they enjoy
When my people are down they just screw us around
Time to change the government now
Panther Power

Panther powr from the place that resides within
Go to for to with a panther and you just can't win
Self proclaimed best supress the rest
The rich get richer and the poor take less
The American dream was the American nightmare
You kept my people down and refused to fight fair
The Ku Klux Klan tried to keep us out
With signs that state No Blacks allowed
With intimidation and segregation
Once would wait for our freedom
But now we're impatient
Blacks they others they yell sell out
Freedom equality get out yell out
Don't eva be ashamed of what you are
It's your Panther power that makes you a star
Panther Power

My mother neva let me forget my history
Hopin' that i would set free cahins that were put on me
Wanted to be more than just free
Had to know tha true facts about my history
I couldn't settle for bein' a statistic
Couldn't survive in this capitalistic government
Cause it was meant to hold us back with ignorance
Drugs and sneak attacks in my community
They killed our unity
But when I charged them they cried immunity
I strike america like a case of heart disease
Panther Power is runnin' through my arteries
Try to stop me homeboy you'll get clawed to death
Cause i'll be fightin for my freedom 'till my dyin' breath

Do you remember that's what I'm askin' you
You think you're livin' free don't make me laugh at you
Open your eyes realise you've been locked in chains
Said you wasn't civilized and stole your name
Cause some time has passed we seem to all firget
There's no liberty for me and you we ain't free yet

I heard a rumour I died, murdered in cold blood dramatized
Pictures of me in my final stage you know Mama cried
But that was fiction, some coward got the story twisted
Like I no longer existed, mysteriously missin
Although I'm worldwide, baby I ain't hard to find
Why I spend most of my time on California crime
Watching for thievin I'm cautious it's like I'm barely breathin
Puttin a bullet in mutherfuckers give me a reason
See me and hope I'm intoxicated or slightly faded
You tried to play me now homicide is my only payment
I'm addicted to currency in this life I lead
Why the fuck you cowards be runnin, too scared to fight a G
For the life of me, I cannot see
How motherfuckers picture livin life after a night of fuckin around with me
And if you don't like this rhyme
then bring your big bad ass to California, cause we ain't hard to find

Pull me up on game, put me up on a hustle

(2Pac)
A smokin ass nigga robbed me blind
I got a TEC-9 now his smokin ass is mine
I guess I felt sorry for the bastard, he was broke
I didn't know he smoked so I didn't watch him close
He caught me on the sneak tip, now the punk's in deep shit
Catch him on the streets, I'ma bring him to his feet, quick
Pass the clip, I think I see him comin now
Fuck the bullshit, posse deep and let's run him down
Gots to be the first one to hit ya when we meet
Comin quickly up the streets, is the punk ass police
The first one jumped out and said, Freeze!
I popped him in his knees and shot him, punk. please.
Cause cops should mind they business, when we rush
Now you're pleadin like a bitch, cause you don't know how to. hush.
Now back to the smoker that robbed me
I tell you like Latifah, motherfucker give me. body.
One to the chest, another to his fuckin dome
Now the shit can rest, yo tell him to leave me the fuck alone
Two very bloody bodies on the streets
A nosey ass cop and a nigga that robbed from me
Run from your backup punk, how you figure?
My finger's on the trigger for you crooked ass niggaz

Now listen to the mack of the crooked nigga trade
With the fine criminal mind, cold rips like a blade
It's already quick steppin to the niggaz with the props
and any motherfucker with the flim-flam drops to the knot
Ten o'clock, is a motherfuckin gank move
Stretch is Uptown, clockin weight the shit is real smooth
A nigga's tryin to play me like he know me but he don't
Sittin on ten keys, I'ma get him, think I won't?
My nigga 2Pac, got the fuckin Glock cocked, and he's ready
When the kid, didn't even bring the weight bag, instead he
welcomed us, into his apartment
Oh this even better, two to the head, he's dead a clean get-a-WAY!
Niggaz got PAID!
And yet another sleepin ass nigga got slayed, word up

Now I could be a crooked nigga too
When I'm rollin with my crew, watch what crooked niggaz, do!
I got a nine millimeter Glock pistol
I'm ready to get witcha at the drop, of a whistle
So make your move, and act like you wanna flip
I fire thirteen shots, and pop another clip
I bring luck, my Glock's like a fuckin mop
The more I shot, the more motherfuckers dropped
And even cops got shot when they rolled up
Best to bring a knot, or get popped, I'm a soldier
I ain't the type to fetch ya, ask Stretch, he's my witness
Smoke til I'm blitzed, fuck a motherfuckin piss test
I'm trigger happy, try to 'tack me and I'll drop you quick
Long as I got a clip I got some shit to hit em with
The nigga killer I get iller when the shit gets thick
My brain flips, I start thinkin like a lunatic
I rip shit, came equipped with a bigger crew
I thought these niggaz knew, I'm a crooked nigga too

Young nation just trying to get this

Murderous mind state, 
Can't keep my nine straight, 
Sippin' on this Hennessy, waiting for the time to break, 
Show up and muthafuckas bow down, recognize

Untouchable mob of pistol packers, 
Well-known felons labeled for 'drug-selling merciless jackers', 
Forever buzz, roll with thugs and dogs, 
Commence the letting off rounds, then escape in the fog, 
Who wants to see me solo? 
Catch Makaveli while he sleeping, 
My mini fourteen murdering niggaz while they creepin, (Uh)

Drink 'til you pass out, 
Ain't scared to die, drunk driving in my glass house,

When it's on, I'm poppin' off every chance I get, 
Out the window on some uptown anthem shit, 
I'm stressin', but ain't no pressure, I been here before, 
Fugitive taskforce at my girlfriends' door, 
Now they checkin' in her bedroom, I ain't there, 
Forty Cals, extended clips, still I ain't scared, 
Outlaw, and best believe they won't take me alive, 
I'm different and I'mma prove it if it take me to die, 
You think God had a plan for me? 
But he won't be layin' up in my casket or doin' life in the can for me, 
Maybe I'm brazen or paranoid than a bitch, 
Me dyin', you think I'd let him see the joy from that shit? 
Walking dead, angels spend their last days by me, 
New Jersey Giant like Dave Tyree, 
Young George or Jonathan Chat, 
Your guns clap, 
Mine will go 'br-r-r-r-att', 
Soldier like Geronimo Pratt, 
And come through cockin' tha black pound, 
When they put the twin towers up, Pac, I'm knockin' 'em back down, 
Poster child, 
Air Force Ones, with the checks, 
I'm supposed to wild sex, 
Money and murder is all I breathe in my life,

I always thought I'd have to die to do a record with Pac, 
So I wrote from the perspective of a graveyard box, 
You end up in the box 'cause them grave robbin' bastards, 
Dig your grave up and snatched you out the casket, 
Worms in my eyes, eating through my cabbage, 
The flesh to the bones, 
The bones to the ashes, 
But I'm not dead, 
I'm actually in a session with the Pac Keeper, Sha Money, progressing, 
They don't really want no drama, I know they goons, 
That's why I keep pressure on 'em like a open wound, 
This God given, he keep givin' me better music, 
So every time you hear me, my songs present improvement, 
Y'all can't kill me, y'all forever losin', 
Songs of evolution, 
If I load your gun for you and we bang it out with some other niggas, you better shoot it, 
Don't try to lie and say you was bustin', I'm clever, stupid, 
Claimin' you reppin' Ruthless, 
You got the same bullets you had when I loaded it for you, you never used it,

When I enter the first zone
Worst known mic holder
My Hummer roll up
Evacuating strapped soldiers
Inside strategy
Manifestin' military styles
Casually try da g
When niggas battle me
My prophesied prediction
Switch and move positions
Separated from his gun and bitch
And watch 'em start snitchin'
I keep spittin' still stupid niggas fail to listen
I personify this thug livin'
Hell or prison
My ammunition varies
My voice carries
Watch me invite the whole world
Me and the mob gettin' married
It seems all the fine screams pierce the dark
This is expected
A trick bitch where is your heart
You mark
Watch niggas fall when I call they name
We outlaws hold your head niggas all the same
Except some who want more out of life than stress
We still thuggin' 'til its none left
Don't sleep

We gon' ride
Keep my pistol on my side
Always creep wit' the nine when I ride (when I ride)

Always hustlin' on the grind
Cause I gotta get mine all the time (all the time)

Dumpin' on motherfuckers at random
Rapidly
Wit' accuracy
They shouldn't talk bad to me
It had to be
A motherfuckin' murder
I'm glad to be
A nigga that did the murder
So sad to see
Another motherfucker floatin'
In plastic reef
Sleep wit' his head wide open (head smokin')
Rapid release
Keep the police coastin'
Casualties
Warrant in deep east Oakland (doors wide open)
Yolk the nigga off the asphalt
Drove off to the hills
Positioned him on his knees and blew the back off
Death with the lex ruger
Death to ya
Niggas cry when the bullets fly
Kill and execute 'em

I blast first 'til they body me
Like my guns in variety
Runnin' wit' the real big willies you silly punks try to be
But front
Doin' my walk by's rollin' a blunt
Hand on my nuts in a getaway car full of stunts
Addicted to my nine
Movin' like crime through time
Poppin' niggas like pimples

Dumpin' on all you punks at intersections
Day in and day out
Ain't no easy way outs or easy exits

When I hit the street
All I can see is the grind
Blood sweat and tears when I bust my rhyme
Yeah I un- for my folk like I load my nine
And when I let loose
Then no crew standin' but mine
I gives a damn 'bout lame nigga actin' schiesty
Same one knew I was in jail and didn't write me
Wanna fight me then come find me
What eva you do shawty you betta think wisely
You might see me wit' a stack in the trap (Aye)

Similar to a saran wrap

like watchin pictures in hazy vision
Tonight is love making, take you any place you wish
Today we satisfied, and today we stole them kisses
Blind insanity, perfect pictures of me and my family
Not understanding it definitely, if they plan for me
If I have kids, will I live to see them grow?
Though I don't know, I live the life of a thug nigga
Until the day I go, no broken promises
A sacred bond broken, I know I die alone
But yet and still I'm hoping
Visions of prisons, maybe I'll be forgiven
I know it's better in heaven.cause being here ain't living

Close my eyes and see nothing but pain, the world is crazy, still
Lookin for a queen to plant seeds and have babies
Maybe I'll be the one or just maybe I'm lost

No jokers, no jacks, just kings and queens
And we should leave the clubs alone and take trips to islands
Give you all of my heart and flood your hands with diamonds
No more living like a player, stop chasin the hoes

I never put you in a shuffle, use my ace in the hole
I live a life full of riches we got places to go
So no bluffing, no rushing, just taking it slow
Let your man do the hustling while you lay in the shade
I'll throw a deuce to the haters, call a spade, a spade
And let you know I'll never hurt you, baby girl

Better go all out

Trying to see the next day

Obstacles in your way
Better go all out

They softer than bitches in worst way drowning in blood

But after Pac stopped rapping ain't no west coast thugs
Just west coast what?

These rappers like Jay-Z
Who be pumping Kool-Aid through their veins

Instead of faking like you can't hear the bed shaking
In bed naked you so twisted think yoour legs breaking
You said take it so I'm blind in my passion, how long will I last?
Doggy style steady pumping on that ass, until I blast
And then I laugh as we lay back
See I wait 'til you asleep and that's the payback
Cause you acting like you did something, giving me a piece
I had you muffling your screams in the sheets, fucking with me

Around my way we lamp, many styles get cramped
I clock rocks in the rain til my socks is damp
Ain't NUTTIN like bein a thug when I can just
sit on the Row of Death straight knowin that I'm blessed
Hussein Fatal, flawless fatality
Overdosin on crime, three steps from reality
Get up to get down, represent your town, last night
was poppin like like cocked glocks with hollow-tip rounds

[Kastro]
From bootycalls to bail sheets, it ain't no tellin
if I wake up in the county in my jail sheets
My intuitions and ambitions up in the late night 
probably involves me comin up with just to see another day
Might be me who bites the bullet
In these streets where a man journey
With crooked cops and a society who tryin to burn me
I'm like a pit in a cage, spittin my shells in a gauge
Deadly as AIDS, niggaz gettin crossed like a maze
Now picture me livin my life like a king, maybe one day
Until then I'm livin Monday through Sunday
Bringin the gunplay for all these beefs and battles
When we collide, I'm a ride on that hide like cattle
Cowards best to skedaddle in the late night

Money and multiple gunshots are shown, large amps are blown
Niggaz in low-lows, pursuin mo' hoes, then go home
The life of a California star, and when you see me
in the drop-top Jag', how many niggaz wanna be me?
Game is automatic, manditory I sell
To Live or Die, I survive, but with a story to tell
Cause when you gettin some riches, watch for dumb bitches
They have you labelled a rapist before you get to tongue-kissin
It's a mean world nigga you strapped, or be a throwaway
Will I survive the late night, to see dawn of day?
Nobody knows me, I'm a shadow
My army fatigues made for battle, pockets full of ammo
Cause when I'm out in the streets, I'm on point, where the static?
Too many done died from semis, so now we automatic
I dissapear whenever heated, ride whenever needed
for my niggaz up in Clentin gettin weeded
Continue to roll until I'm old, ride until I die
Supply long as you motherfuckers buy
My homies rolled by in a bucket, but they ain't short and duckin
Slappin niggaz known for tellin bitches FUCK-IT in the late night

[Verse One: 2Pac]

Tell me, how many real motherfuckers feel me? I smoke a blunt
and freak the funk until these jealous motherfuckers kill me
I'm out the gutter, pick a hero
I'm 165 and staying high til I die, my competion's zero
Cause I could give a fuck about you, better duck
Or I'll be forced to hit yo ass up I give a fuck
I'm sick inside my mind, why you sweatin me?
It's gonna take an army full of crooked ass cops to come and get me
Niggaz know I ain't the one to sleep on, I'm under pressure
Gotta sleep with my piece, an extra clip beside my dresser
Word to God I've been ready to die since I was born
I don't want no shit but niggaz trip and yo it's on
Open fire on my adversaries, don't even worry
Better have on a vest aim for the chest and then you buried
It's a man's world, niggaz get played, another stray
Hope I live to see another day, hey
I'm getting sweated by these undercovers, who can I trust?
Got my mama stressin thinkin it's a drug bust
Gotta get paid but all the drama that's attached
We living a Drug Life, Thug Life, each day could be my last
Will I blast when it's time to shoot? Don't even ask
That's the consequences when ya livin, fast
Six bricks of tricks, for my niggaz, I gotta come up
and recoup, you keep the dope just bring me six figures
Is it a bust? I hear the sirens, run for cover
over the fence and open fire

""Alright now, here we go""

[Verse Two: 2Pac]

These motherfuckers on my ass I'm in traffic, will it be tragic?
I'm comin round the corner like I'm Magic
Doin ninety on the freeway, and hittin switches
In a high speed chase with these punk bitches
Don't turn around I ain't givin up, cause they don't worry me
Pussy ass bitches better bury me
Runnin outta gas time to park it, I'm on foot
We in the hood, how the fuck they gon catch a crook? Haha
I got away cause I'm clever
Went to my neighbors for a favor now you know players stick together
I watch the scene from the rooftop, spittin loogies
at the coppers that persue me, beotch!
I be a hustler til it's over, motherfucker
Open fire on you bustas

""Alright now, here we go""

[Verse Three: 2Pac]

Don't try to follow me, I'm headed outta state
I gotta pay my fuckin bills, so I'm transportin weight
Change my plates, pick up my nigga, and now we rollin
Droppin keys like they stolen, hehe
Tell me who do you fear? I'm outta town until the coast is clear
Enough dope to last a year
They got me running from the police, nowhere to go
With the lights out, rollin down a dirt road
But I ain't goin alive, I'd rather die than be a convict
I'd rather fire on my target
I hit the corner doing ninety, ahhhh shit!
Them bitches right behind me
They take a shot and hit my fuckin tires
Now, jump out the car then I open fire, sucka!

Ain't that a bitch them motherfuckers gotta beef with me
They make it hard for me to sleep
I wake up at the slightest peep and my sheets are 3 feet deep
I guess it's hard for you to see 
But now I'm pointin the finger at police instead of motherfuckers blamin' me
I got the right to bear a pistol
And when them punk motherfuckers get to trippin' I got shit too
And maybe then you'll see the truth
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too

Livin like a Don in my own mind
Signal Kadafi, nigga watch me with the chrome nine
All the time drinkin champagne
Walk through the crowd let the tramps hang
Niggas playa hate but do a damn thing
Picture me doin eighty down a one way
Stuck in the trunk, caught with gun play
So I gotta keep my eyes open
Gettin high, wonder why we gotta die smokin
My alibi, I'm victory
Like them other vile men I'm marked for death
Spendin my nights like its the last one left
I'm an outlaw

Am I wrong, I wanna get it goin on
Last to leave, till I see everybodys gone
I'm at the bar you can catch me hands full of liquor
Puffin on a sweet submission I'm the last one left
Tell me am I wrong, I wanna get it goin on
Last to leave until I see everybodys gone
I'm at the bar you can catch me hands full of liquor
Puffin on a sweet swisher, guess I'm the last one left

(Kastro)
I got my back against the wall
Gat chillin by my balls
Prior to war is rider nigga only five six tall
Napoleon only knows on we outlaws fuck fear
Better strap down to the feelins cause we out yeah
Thug passion all up in me
Feelin like I took some Henne
It aint easy I'm tryin to make a dollar out of two pennies
What we got with these rap niggas
Wanna pull they're gat niggas
Only got my side cause they think pac die nigga
Last niggas with our tape
Take a shot within our vest
Pac come and catch weight
Nigga we the last ones left

(2Pac)
If we woulda known the zone inside my own dome
Fresh outs jail it was hell but I'm probably home
Lookin for niggas that was roofin that shit when I was locked back
Hands on the pump, makem jump when its cocked back
Fuckem all they're bitches inside a world of weak
Bitch niggas be afraid to speak
We the last ones left

(2Pac)
(Chorus (slight change))
Tell me am I wrong, I wanna get it goin on
Last to leave, till I see everybodys gone
At the bar you can catch me hands full of liquor
Puffin on a sweet swisher Like I'm the last one left
Am I wrong, I wanna get it goin on
Last to leave till I see everybodys gone
At the bar you can catch me hands full of liquor
Puffin on a sweet swisher, last one left
Am I wrong, I wanna get it goin on
Last to leave till I see everybodys gone
At the bar you can catch me hands full of liquor (Yeah)
Puffin on a sweet swisher, I'm the last one left

I eat and sleep the worst shit, turfs and birth
Me and my team super supreme putin in work
I'm passed out, drunk as a fuck, till it hurt
And I call earl screamin fuck the world
I got a bitch on the side wanna be my wife
And wify beefin wanna know if she gonna see me tonight
And i know it aint right, but its the life I got
And thats until I see Yak
And thats until I see Pac
Young know I lost a troll somebody owed me down
And if the world was a girl I'd stick my dick in the ground
Fuck the world

Actually talk to the mother fuckers that persevered
I mean the first motherfuckers that came in the slave ships
Excuse me, excuse me you know look

We back for everything you owe, no longer oppressed
'Cause now we overthrow those that placed us in this rotten mess
But let's agree on strategy and pick out enemies right
Who stands accused of the abuse my own, kind do right
Pardon, not disregardin' what you thinkin'?
But you musta been the ship
'Cause once I rip your whole shit is sinkin'
Supreme ideology, you claim to hold
Claimin' that we all drug dealers with empty souls
That used to tempt me to roll, commit to violence
In the midst of an act of war, witnesses left silent
Shatter, black talon style, thoughts I throw
It remains in your brain then ofcourse it grows
Maybe, even your babies can produce and rise
Picture a life where black babies can survive past five
But we must have hope, quotin' the reverand from the pulpit
Refuse to turn the other cheek we must defeat the evil culprit
Lace me with words of destruction and I'll explode
But supply me with the will to survive, and watch the world grow
This ain't bout talkin' bout problems, I bring solutions
Where's the restitution, stipulated through the constitution
You violated, now I'm back to haunt your nights
Listen to the screams of the lives you sacrificed
And in case you don't know, ghetto born black seeds still grow

We comin' back for everythin' you owe

I'm comin' collectin' the shit that belong to me
Motherfuckers are runnin' and duckin'
How do you plead Mr. Shakur, how do you plead?
I'm a crazy nigga on a mission wit a bad mentality

How do I plead? Yes sir, how do you plead?
Armed with missiles guns grenades

Shit, you know how I plead comeon
Pull out the pin, free I'm comin'
Not guilty on the grounds of insanity it was them or me
Bustin' at my innocent family, say they lookin for kiss

I was home alone, blind to the prelude
Bust in, talkin' about, ""Where is the quaaludes?"" What you say fool?
Where in the hell is the search warrant?

No feedback is what he uttered
Before he screamed nigga motherfucker
Dropped me to my knees I proceed to bleed
Sufferin' a rain of blows to my hands and knees
Will I survive, is God watchin'?
I grab his gat and bust in self defense, my only option, goddamn
Now they got me goin' to the county jail
And my family can't pay this outrageous bail
Try to offer me a deal, they told me if I squeal
Move me, and my people, to a mansion in brazil
Not me, so this is how it ends, no friends
I'll be stressed and they just, reposessed my Benz
Told the judge it was self defense, he won't listen
So I'm bumpin' this in federal prison, givin everything I owe
I'm comin' collectin' the shit that belong to me

Motherfuckers are runnin' and duckin'
I'm a crazy nigga on a mission wit a bad mentality
Armed with missiles guns grenades
Pull out the pin, free I'm comin'

I'm comin' collectin' the shit that belong to me

I guess nobody loves a real nigga-slash-rap singer
I thought I'd bring a little truth to the young troops
I brought proof that the niggaz need guns too
It's not to be a racist, but let's face this:
wouldn't you if we could trade places?
I got lynched by some crooked cops, and to this day
them same motherfuckers on the beat gettin major paid
But when I get my check they takin tax out
So, we payin for these pigs to knock the blacks out
Ain't that a bitch, some officers are gettin rich
Whoopin on thugs and robbin drug dealers for they shit
As far as jealousy, bein a celebrity
No matter who committed the crime, they all yell at me
And the media is greedier than most
You could sell em your soul or they'll be on ya til a niggaz ghost
And everyday I read the paper there's another lie
They show my picture for the crimes of another guy
Now how's that for the life of a big shot
A dead cop, a law suit, a little kid shot
I play them nuttin ass marks in the park
for tryin to earn they stripes in the dark
Just cause I come there, don't mean I from there, peep:
only jealous motherfuckers beef, and point the finga

Buckshots are the payback for dumb shit
All you niggaz on the block tryin to test me
Best wear a vest or get open like, sesame
I'll run up on you mad deep; while you're tryin to sleep
I'm steady pumpin bullets in your sheets
Wake up, motherfucker, don't stutter
Point blank by a nigga from the gutter, yeah!
Gimme mine, gimme mine, gimme, mine
Ban my rhymes, now I'm back to bustin, nines
And bustaz can't get none, hell no

Everbody fuckin wit us so can't you see
It's hard to be a man.
Ridin wit my gun in hand.

Why explain the game? Niggas ain't listenin.
Stuck in positions. If victims can't stand the heat,
Then stay the fuck out the kitchen.
Have these bustas switchin, lookin at me mean.
Itchin, givin suckas plenty space.
Have these bitch niggas snitchin.
Where are we now? Guns found daily.
The feds surely hope that they could finally nail me for sellin dope.
They backwards, make tracks burst whenever I rap.
Attack. Words bein known to explode on contact.
Extreme at times. Blinded by my passion and fury.
Look at me laugh at my competition's flashin my jewelry.
You'd stay silent if you niggas knew me. Truely effective.
The shit you heard ain't do me justice. Got a death wish, bitch.
Run up, face me and trace wit an infared beam.
It seems niggas ain't recognize my team.
Ain't nobody holdin you back. Explode the track to confetti.
Unload it. Cuz niggas ain't ready. The life of an outlaw.

[Chorus repeats]

Code 3. Attack formation. Pull out your pistols.
Keep an eye out for the devils cuz they itchin to get you.
Mercy to this madman screamin kamikaze in tongue.
Automatic gunfire makin all my enemies run.
Who should I call when I'm shot and bleedin.
Indeed the possibility has part a chase in cream.
Dope got me hatin fiends. Scheam wit my team, just a chosen few.
My foes victim of explosives. Come closer. Exhale the fumes.
We got memories fadin fast. A slave for cash.
Accelerate, mash, blast, then dash.
Don't look now. How you like it, raw.
Niggas ain't ready for the wrath of the outlaws. Never surrender.
Death is for a son to stay free. I'm thugged out.
Fuck the world cuz this is how they made me.
Scarred but still breathin.
Believe in me and you could see the victory.
A warrior with jewels. Will you picture me?
Life of and outlaw.

[Chorus repeats]

City under siege. It's like I can't even breathe.
I'm from the state of car theives. G, deep from the street.
Plenty beef. I play for keeps, arrange the whole crime scene.
Mobb Deep. This nigga from behind tryin to creep.
No halfs wit no straps, jack.
It's on to bounce back.
And an ounce so fat, they snatch my style ?
Get this grip wit hollows to get cha.
Snip wit clippers. Get the picture?
I wrote my life down like a scripture.

And I'm still on lost in the land of the lonely.
Where ain't nobody holy. A matter of a fact, we unholy.
Everybody livin soley for themselves. Too hostile on a land hell.
Somebody need me. You know we lost hope and we needin it.
Wit the evil it's forever. But it might be low down, scandalouz
Like a tramp is. All for the street fame on how to be managed.
To plan shit. 6 months in advaced to what we plotted.
Approved to go on swole and now I got it.

Un uh, crack my window. Knowin they'd love to catch Kastro sleepin.
Attach a strap under my pillow and a hand like we freakin.
Creepin deep into morning. Peepin out the weak.
While they yawnin and let my cloud speak for it's self.
No doubt. Outlaw. Outta my mind, outta time. You're all blind.
Some kind of life of mine Kato don't mind.
Findin it funny, matter of fact, cuz it is.
Perhaps finally I look at that true over the years as an outlaw.
Eh, Noble.
What's up nigga.
Would you die for me, nigga?
Hell yeah.
Would you kill for me?
On my grandmother, nigga.
Ah yo.
What's up.
Let's ride on them stupid bitches right now.
Watch out.

Well now they all say they roaches and parasites.
Snakes and all they might
Thug Life break night.
Drink till we fist fight.
Life or death. But you can't win with a vest.
But there won't be no breathing for the reason
Punk bitch on your breath.
I see day is dark and I admit it's dark.
So chase ?
Beware foolin marks.

How do we keep the music playing
One Thug, One Thug

I wake up early in the morning
mind state so military
Suckas fantasizing
Pictures of a young brother buried
Was it me
The Weed
Or this life I lead
If daytime is for suckas then tonight we breathe
Out for all that
Knowing that this world brings drawbacks
Look how they shiver
Once I deliver these war raps
Meet me at the cemetery dressed in black
Tonight we
Honor the dead, those who won't be back
So if I die do the same for me
Shed no tears
An Outlaw, thug living in this game for years
Why worry?
Hope to God
Get me high when I'm buried
Knowing deep inside only a few love me
Don't rush me through the gates of heaven
Let me picture for a while
How I lived from my days as a child
I wonder now
How do we outlast, always get cash
Stay strong if we all mash
Hold Your head

How do we keep the music playing
(You got to hold your head)
How do we get ahead
(Hold your head)
Too many young black brothers are dying

These felonies be like prophecies
Begging me to stop
Cause these lawyers getting money every time they knock us
Snatch they pockets lyrically
Suckas flee when they notice
Switched my name to Makaveli
Had the rap game closed
Expose foes, with my hocus pocus flows, they froze
Now suckas idolize my chosen blows
And more money, mean litigating
More playa hating
Got a cell at the Penn for me waiting
Is this my fate?
Miss me with that misdemeanor thinking
We fall back
Never had too much Tequilla drinking
We all that
Make them understand me
You lie to say my posse
Everyone roll with me is family
Cause every bodies got me
Watch me paint a perfect vision
This life we living
Got us all meeting up in prison
Last week I got a letter from my road dog
Written in blood
Saying Please show a young playa love
Hold your head
Hold it

(Weed got me thinking in my mind)

God bless the child that can hold is own
Indeed
Enemies bleed when I hold my chrome
Let these words be the last
To my unborn seeds
Hope to raise my young nation in this world of greed
Currency means nothing if you still ain't free
Money breeds jealousy, take the game from me
I hope for better days
Trouble comes naturally
Running from authorities
Till they capture me
And my aim, is to spread more smiles than tears
Utilize lessons learned from my childhood years
Maybe mama had it all right
Rest your head
Straight conversation all night
Bless the dead
To the homies that I used to have
That no longer roll
Catch a brother at the crossroads
Plus, nobody knows my soul
Watching time pass
Through the glass of my drop top Rolls

Time to make the bed rock, baby look how it rise
Me and you movin in the nude, do it in the living room
Sweatin up the sheets, it's the Thug in me
I mean no disrespectin when I tongue kiss your neck
I go a long way to get you wet, what you expect
Late night, hit the highway, drop the top
I pull over, gettin busy in the parking lot
And don't you love it how I lick your, hips and glide
Kiss you soft on your stomach, push my love inside

Screamin' like you're dyin' every time I'm fuckin' you

No need to fear

""I wanted to bring back that reality, nobody can ever be confused and think I'm fuckin Mike Tyson
and I'm the heavyweight champion, I'm a little nigga, thats why its so raw to just watch me
battle lions, cause I'm a little skinny nigga battlin' niggas three times my size.""

Watch this uppercut, here it comes... watch the jab nigga...ugh...

Verse 1 - 2pac

Lets see so many motherfuckers wanna take a piece

my middle finger to you hoe niggas run up on me,
and ill be forced to let it go nigga
i aint the one you wanna try, why, stayin high
i hit the blunt an watch these motherfuckers die
whose runnin the streets i sell that cocaine
cause in the the dope game, niggas'll die 'fore they go broke mayne
another hustler makin' major cash
'til the punk police come raid your ass
now you stressed doin' fed time, and its a bitch
cause the judge gave you 8 years, you doin 6

Verse 2 - 2pac

They got a nigga in the dice game, i'm feelin' lucky

No need to run for the trunk, i get em' up

i love my niggas, but i aint puttin down my glock
the gun shots rang when i lose nigga, and ooh nigga

lay it down just to prove it
and fuck the rappin motherfucker we can do this

Chorus (x1)

Verse 3 - Outlawz (EDI & Young Noble)

They claim that we violent, we named after tyrants
this revolution wont be televised, we keep it silent (shh)
roll on our enemies, beat em' at they own game
molotov cocktails, releasing up in flames
tired of bein' stepped on, sick of bein' held back
lookin' through my rear view, thinkin' bout the pay back
wanna see my kids grow dont know if imma make it though
one more nigga came up short in the ghetto
society lied to me so im strapped with the metal
push ya middle finger up nigga if you a rebel
have ya face down goin in ya pockets if ya let em
i done lost too many homies for me to ever forget em
i done made so many mistakes but still i dont regret em
im a product of the pimp, the pusher, and the reverend
im a product of the block, the fiends, and the felons
we all lost souls tryina find our way to heaven

Chorus (x1)

Edi talking:
""to all the comrads no longer with us, see you when we get there
'Pac, Yak, we gon' keep on ridin', give these cowards the uppercut

"104","2pac","Picture Me Rollin'*","All Eyez On Me",1996,"Yeah, clear enough for ya?
Why you niggas look mad?
Y'all supposed to be happy I'm free!
Y'all niggas look like y'all wanted me to stay in jail
Ho bustas!

Picture me rolling in my 500 Benz
I got no love for these niggas, there's no need to be friends
They got me under surveillance, that's what somebody be telling
Know there's dope being sold, but I ain't the one selling
Don't want to be another number
I gotta puff a gang of weed to keep from going under
The federales wanna see me dead
Niggas put prices on my head
Now I got two Rottweilers by my bed, I feed 'em lead
Now I'm released, how will I live?
Will God forgive me for all the dirt a nigga did, to feed kids?
One life to live, it's so hard to be positive
When niggas shooting at your crib
Mama, I'm still thuggin', the world is a war zone
My homies is inmates, and most of them dead wrong
Full grown, finally a man, just scheming on ways
To put some green inside the palms of my empty hands
Just picture me rollin'
Flossing a Benz on rims that isn't stolen
My dreams is censored, my hopes are gone
I'm like a fiend that finally sees when all the dope is gone
My nerves is wrecked, heart beating and my hands are swollen
Thinking of the G's I'll be holdin'
Picture me rollin'

Picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'
Picture me, picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'
Ooh wee

Can you see me now?
Move to the side a little bit so you can get a clear picture
Can you see it?
Picture me rollin'
Yeah nigga!
Ay, but peep how my nigga Syke do it to you
Guess who's back?

I got ki's coming from overseas
Cost a nigga 200 G's
I'm a street commando, Nino for example
This lavish lifestyle is hard to handle
So I got to floss cause I'm more like a boss player
Thug, branded to be a women-layer
So many player haters, imitators steady swanging
Make me wanna start back banging
So I'm caught up in the game, dress code changed
Packing 40 Glocks, contain em or rearrange
All that jealousy and envy coming from my enemies
While I'm sipping on Remy
In front of black Lexus, Chevy's on the roam
'96 big body, sitting on chrome
As we head up out the zone, stone-facing is on
You can admire, but don't look too long
I'm living a dream with triple beams and my pockets bulgin'
It's hard to imagine
Picture me rollin'

Picture me rollin'

Picture, picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'
Picture me

I gots to get the fuck up in it, formulate a caper
Cause a nigga straight suffering from lack of having paper

My bitch fin' to have a bastard, see?
So I needs to hit a lick, drastically
I see some ballin' ass niggas, and they slippin' in my spot
And, uh, diggin' the plots (so what?)
Checking in the park, 'Pac

We caught em sleeping, he didn't peep you niggas creeping?
This how we do it every weekend

I dump for madness, it's time to count the profit
CPO, we got the bomb spot, nigga time to clock it
I get the liquor, and you could get the females
This crooked shit that we inflicting getting street sales

Move smooth as a motherfucker, me and my 9
I'm as cool as a motherfucker, I'ma get mine
Now we satisfied, got the pockets on swollen
Boss Hog and this 'Pac nigga: picture us rollin'

(repeat 'till end)
Picture me rollin'

Is y'all ready for me?
Picture me rollin"" roll call
You know there's some muh'fuckers out there

I wanna make sure they can see me
Number one on my list: Clinton Correctional Facilities
All you bitch ass C.O.'s
Can you niggas see me from there?
Ballin' on y'all punk ass!
Picture me rollin', baby

"105","2pac","Trapped*","2Pacalypse Now",1991,"You know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion
Happiness, living on tha streets is a delusion
Even a smooth criminal one day must get caught
Shot up or shot down with tha bullet that he bought
Nine millimeter kickin' thinking about what tha streets do to me
Cause they never talk peace in tha black community
All we know is violence, do tha job in silence
Walk tha city streets like a rat pack of tyrants
Too many brothers daily heading for tha big penn
Niggas commin' out worse off than when they went in
Over tha years I done alot of growin' up
Getten drunk thrown' up
Cuffed up
Then I said I had enough
There must be another route, way out
To money and fame, I changed my name
And played a different game
Tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle
If one more cop harrasses me I just might go psycho
And when I gettem
I'll hit em with tha bum rush
Only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed
Yo, if your smart you'll really let me go 'G'
But keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch tha uzi
They got me trapped...

(Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
They got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
Trapped
(Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
Trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)

They got me trapped
Can barely walk tha city streets
Without a cop harrassing me, searching me
Then asking my identity
Hands up, throw me up against tha wall
Didn't do a thing at all
I'm tellen you one day these suckers gotta fall
Cuffed up throw me on tha concrete
Coppers try to kill me
But they didn't know this was tha wrong street
Bang bang, down another casualty
But it's a cop who's shot there's brutality
Who do you blame?
It's a shame because tha mans slain
He got caught in tha chains of his own game
How can I feel guilty after all tha things they did to me
Sweated me, hunted me
Trapped in my own community
One day i'm gonna bust
Blow up on this society
Why did ya lie to me?
I couldn't find a trace of equality
Work me like a slave while they laid back
Homie don't play that
It's time I lett'em suffer tha payback
I'm tryin to avoid physical contact
I can't hold back, it's time to attack jack
They got me trapped

(Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
You know they got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
Trapped
(uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
You know they got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)

Now i'm trapped and want to find a getaway
All I need is a 'G' and somewhere safe to stay
Can't use tha phone
Cause i'm sure someone is tappin in
Did it before
Ain't scared to use my gat again
I look back at hindsite the fight was irrelevant
But now he's tha devils friend
Too late to be tellin' him
He shot first and i'll be damned if I run away
Homie is done away I should of put my gun away
I wasn't thinkin' all I heard was tha ridicule
Girlies was laughin', Tup sayin Damn homies is dissin you
I fired my weapon
Started steppin' in tha hurricane
I got shot so I dropped
Feelin' a burst of pain
Got to my feet
Couldn't see nothin' but bloody blood
Now i'm a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer
Ran through an alley
Still lookin' for my getaway
Coppers said Freeze, or you'll be dead today
Trapped in a corner
Dark and I couldn't see tha light
Thoughts in my mind was tha nine and a better life
What do I do?
Live my life in a prison cell
I'd rather die than be trapped in a living hell
They got me trapped

(Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
They got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
Trapped
(uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
You know they got me trapped

"106","2pac","Out On Bail","Loyal To The Game",2004,"[Intro: Tupac Talking]
Oh, I posted bail?
I'm out this motherfucker?
I can go?
Oh, fuck y'all eh, fuck the judge
Fuck the motherfuckin' district attourney and the prosecutor (fuck you!)
And fuck you motherfuckers in the jury box (fuck you!)
Fuck all y'all
Cause I'm out on motherfuckin' bail
y'all ain't never gonna see me in this motherfucker again
Drop that shit em!
Let these old punk ass bitches know how we runnin' this shit
Niggaz ain't going back to court you stank ass bitches

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Im stuck in jail the DA's tryin' to burn me
I'd be out on bail if I had a good attorney
Wanna label me a criminal and cuff me up
Got a pocket full of money so they rough me up
I ain't trippin' in the county and I'm mad as fuck
Got a record so they put me with the baddest bunch
Everybody wanna talk cause I'm rappin'
They askin' me what happened
Is it true you did a flick with Janet Jackson
I can't sleep they takin' polaroids
And I'm tryna to use the phone but they makin' noise
Man I wish I had my glock cause its major
I'm makin' shanks out the plastics in razors
These motherfuckers won't leave me alone thats my word
Bout to turn a violation to a motherfuckin' murder
I'm makin' collect calls to my old bitches
Send mo' pictures and make me some more riches
To all the suckers on the block talkin' shit while I was locked up
Be prepared to get socked up
Cause the game is deep and the fame is brief
And you bullshittin' bitches ain't changin' me
I came straight up out the gutta I was saved from hell
I'm a thug I was raised in jail
Now I'm out on bail

[Chorus x1]
Out on Bail (You know what fuckin' time it is)
ThugLife will never fail (I'm out on bail)
Thuglife niggaz (I'm going straight to 50,000 BIATCH!!!)
Thuglife niggaz (I'm out on bail)
Out on Bail (Hey, hand me some motherfuckin' Colt 40's from the fridge nigga)
ThugLife will never fail (Cause I'm out on bail)
Thuglife niggaz (Hey, pass me my motherfuckin' Rolex)
Thuglife niggaz (Yes bitch that's a President)

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Stuck in jail and mad as a bitch
I'd be out on bail if it wasn't for the snitch
Runnin' wild thru the streets like I'm loco
And fuck the punk police and they chokeholds
I got no love in my heart cause I'm heartless
Mobbin' in the park after dark wanna start shit
Rippin' up the scene as a teen I was at it (but hey)
And sellin' products to the addicts cause they gotta have it
I was a well-known thug and I gotta lotta love
Hangin out with the OG's shootin' up the clubs
And mama told me don't hang with the homies
But they got me if they need me then it's on G
Got me sittin' in the cell a five by seven
Will I finally get to go to ghetto heaven
Got my bitches on the outside writin' me letters
And they tell me they love me and the shit ull get better
I don't believe her cause I just got the news on the wire
Take it how you want it but your bitch is on fire
I gotta be a player so I stay strong
cause I know that I won't be away long
and when I finally do hit the fuckin' streets I'ma handle this
A thug nigga gettin' scandalous
I'm on bail

[Chorus x1]
Out on Bail
ThugLife (see) will never fail (Out on bail - biatch!)
Thuglife niggaz (You know what time it is)
Thuglife niggaz (I'm out on bail)
Out on Bail (Y'all don't need to know about...)
ThugLife will never fail (You know, Out on bail)
Thuglife niggaz (Y'all Blow that shit - Get me up out this)
Thuglife niggaz (Yo, EM!!! Get me up out of this motherfucker man!)
Out on Bail (These motherfuckers are harrasing me and that ain't cool)

"107","2pac","Hit 'Em Up (Live)","Greatest Hits",2011,"I ain't got no motherfucking friends
That's why I fucked your bitch you fat motherfucker
West Side, Bad Boy killers
You know who the realest is

We bring it too
Take money, take money

First off, fuck your bitch and the clique you claim
Westside when we ride, come equipped with game

You claim to be a player but I fucked your wife

We bust on Bad Boys, niggas fucked for life

Plus Puffy tryna see me, weak hearts I rip
Biggie Smalls and Junior M.A.F.I.A. some mark-ass bitches
We keep on coming while we running for your jewels
Steady gunning, keep on busting at them fools
You know the rules
Lil' Caesar go ask you homie how I'll leave you
Cut your young ass up, leave you in pieces
Now be deceased
Little Kim, don't fuck around with real G's
Quick to snatch your ugly ass off the streets
So fuck peace
I'll let them niggas know it's on for life
Don't let the Westside ride the night

Bad Boy murdered on wax and killed
Fuck with me and get your caps peeled
You know

Grab your Glocks when you see 2Pac
Call the cops when you see 2Pac
Who shot me, but your punks didn't finish

Now you about to feel the wrath of a menace

Nigga I hit em up

Check this out
You motherfuckers know what time it is

I don't know why I'm even on this track
You all niggas ain't even on my level
I'm going to let my little homies ride on you bitch-made ass Bad Boy bitches

Get out the way, yo, get out the way, yo

Biggie Smalls just got dropped

Little Moo' pass the Mac and let me hit em in his back
Frank White needs to get spanked right for setting traps
Little accident-murderer
And I ain't never heard of you

Poisonous gats attack when I'm serving you

Spank you, shank your whole style when I gank

Guard your rank, cause I'm a slam your ass in the paint
Puffy weaker than the fuckin' block I'm running through, nigga
And I'm smoking Junior M.A.F.I.A. in front of you, nigga
With the ready-power tucked in my Guess
Under my Eddie Bauer
Your clout petty/sour
I push packages every hour, I hit em up

Peep how we do it
Keep it real as penitentiary steel
This ain't no freestyle battle
All you niggas getting killed with your mouths open
Trying to come up off of me, you in the clouds hoping
Smoking dope, it's like a sherm high

Niggas think they learned to fly

But they burn, motherfucker, you deserve to die

Talking about you getting money

But it's funny to me
All you niggas living bummy
Why you fucking with me?
I'm a self-made millionaire!
Thug livin', out of prison
Pistols in the air
Biggie, remember when I used to let you sleep on the couch
And beg a bitch to let you sleep in the house?
Now it's all about Versace, you copied my style

5 shots couldn't drop me, I took it and smiled

Now I'm back to set the record straight

With my AK, I'm still the thug that you love to hate
Motherfucker I'll hit em up

I'm from N-E-W Jers'
Where plenty of murders occurs
No points or commas, we bring drama to all you herbs
Now go check the scenario: Lil' Cease
I'll bring you fake G's to your knees
Copping pleas in de Janeiro
Little Kim, is you coked up or doped up?

Get your little Junior Whopper click smoked up

What the fuck, is you stupid?
I take money, crash and mash through Brooklyn
With my click looting, shooting and polluting your block
With a 15-shot cocked Glock to your knot
Outlaw MAFIA clique moving up another notch
And your pop stars popped and get mopped and dropped
And all your fake ass East Coast props
Brainstormed and locked

You's a beat biter
A Pac style taker
I'll tell you to your face you ain't shit but a faker
Softer than Alize with a chaser
About to get murdered for the paper
E.D.I Mean approach the scene of the caper
Like a loc, with Little Ceas' in a choke
Gun totin' smoke. We ain't no motherfucking joke
Thug Life, niggas better be known
Be approaching in the wide open, gun smoking
No need for hoping, it's a battle lost
I got em crossed as soon as the funk is bopping off
Nigga, I hit em up!

Now you tell me who won
I see them, they run
They don't wanna see us
Whole Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique dressing up trying to be us
How the fuck they gonna be the mob when we always on our job?
We millionaires, killing ain't fair but somebody got to do it
Oh yeah, Mobb Deep: you wanna fuck with us
You little young-ass motherfuckers
Don't one of you niggas got sickle-cell or something
You're fucking with me, nigga
You fuck around and catch a seizure or a heart attack
You better back the fuck up
Before you get smacked the fuck up
This is how we do it on our side
Any of you niggas from New York that want to bring it, bring it
But we ain't singing, we bringing drama
Fuck you and your motherfucking mama
We gon kill all you motherfuckers
Now when I came out, I told you it was just about Biggie
Then everybody had to open their mouth with a motherfucking opinion
Well this is how we gonna do this
Fuck Mobb Deep, fuck Biggie
Fuck Bad Boy as a staff, record label and as a motherfucking crew
And if you want to be down with Bad Boy, then fuck you too
Chino XL: fuck you too
All you motherfuckers, fuck you too (Take money, take money)
All of y'all mother fuckers, fuck you, die slow, motherfucker
My .44 make sure all y'all kids don't grow
You motherfuckers can't be us or see us
We motherfuckin' Thug Life-riders
Westside til we die
Out here in California, nigga, we warned ya
We'll bomb on you motherfuckers. We do our job
You think you mob? Nigga, we the motherfuckin' mob
Ain't nothing but killers and the real niggas

Runnin' from the police

No matter what I do, they got a nigga
Still runnin' from the police
(Put them motherfuckin' Nike's on tight and get ghost, y'all)

I ain't got nuttin' on my mind but gettin' in some trouble
Lickin' shots to they block, leavin' bloody blood puddles
For some ridah delight, now we in a gunfight
I can shoot the gauge pebbles at the devils or die tonight

It's on me but if I die, bury me a motherfuckin' G
A open casket on them bastards so they all remember me
With my vest on my chest, my tools and my piece
'Thug Life', motherfucker, gotta me runnin' from the police

Nigga, you know that's true
Catch a nigga like K-Dog, chillin' wit a crew
Every damn day parlay with my glass of Re
The O.J. and it's all okay

'Til that fuckin' fake cop got to play the man
Ran me down the block with my glass in my hand
Damn, I hope it don't spill
Nigga, chill, shit is real cock back my steel

Still runnin' from the police I gets no sleep
I got you peepin' in my window while I'm smokin' indo
But I ain't no motherfuckin' track star, pig's got a Jeep
Like Big Mouth, runnin' through motherfucker's backyards

So I grabs my piece before I flee
And instead of me runnin', these bitches is runnin' from me
Lick shots, hits spots off on my piece
'Cause a nigga like Big Mouth is through runnin' from the police

I bust off, what? About the time they pull me from the Bronco
Lay, they tried to cock me but them can't gun store
When a batty bwoy do it from the mob
Ahh, pull up your pants then you screw an left squad

Look around, look around, punk police
While gwan man doesn't a come but a bad boy test
Look around, look around, punk police
Me hafta blast back 'cause de blast is best

Yo I was schemin' and fiendin' for loots and took the crooked route
To ghetto fame, I felt the pains and now I run the game
The insane brain, cold gettin' fly like a plane
On them suckers with my nigga Biggie Smalls causin' ruckus

Check it, I grew up a fuckin' screw-up
Gotduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up
Choppin' rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls tryin' to turn into the black Frank White

And we got the workers choppin' rock, Benz by the flock
And we gettin' it, the dirty cops are jealous, so they sweatin' it
I'm lettin' off smoke, hope they don't play me for no joke
And provoke the homicide, so just let the drama slide

We keepin' it real, fuck how you feel, Biggie pass the steel
Let's serve these motherfuckers slugs as a fuckin' meal
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missin'

Show they toes, you know they got stepped on
A fist full of bullets, a chest full of Teflon
Run from the police, picture that, nigga, I'm too fat
I fuck around and catch a asthma attack

That's why I bust back, it don't phase me
When he drop, take his glock and I'm Swayze
Celebrate my escape, sold the glock, bought some weight
Laid back, I got some money to make, motherfucker

Now it's war, me tryin' to sell, runnin' from the punk police
They try to cock me but them can't gun store
What about they come to hold up me North
Pulled up the park, I left school and left buck

Look around, look around, punk police
Was about to blast with ya gun but you can't stop me
Look around, look around, punk police
Me haf to blast back, cause blast back best

They got me runnin' from the five O
Duckin' and dodgin' in my survival
The Benzo and I let off with my nine, hoe
I'm movin' swifter than the next nigga, no time for sex
'Cause in my mind all I wonder is who's next

Nigga, my homey slipped and now he pays the price
He did a drive-by, sixteen, now he's doin' triple life
Tell me is it me or my upbringin', I spit that thug shit
Nigga, motherfuck singin', I hope you got your Timberlands
On tight 'cause I ain't givin up

I'd rather duck these motherfuckers all night
I'm runnin' through the projects, beyotch
They'll never catch me
'Cause I'm loc'd and trigger happy on the sneotch

Don't say you never heard of me
'Til they murder me, I'm a legend

just looking back at the world
from another level
staring.

Multiple gunshots fill the block, the fun stops
Niggaz is callin cops, people shot, nobody stop
I wonder when the world stopped caring last night
Two kids shot while the whole block staring
I will never understand this society, first they try
to murder me, then they lie to me, product of a dying breed
All my homies trying weed, now the little baby's
crazed raised off Hennesey, tell me will my enemies
flee when they see me, believe me
Even Thugs gotta learn to take it easy, listen
Through the intermissions search your heart for a plan

and we turning Bad Boys to grown men, it's on again

I give a holla to my niggaz in the darkest corners
Roll a perfect blunt, and let me spark it for ya

One love from a thug nigga rolling with a posse
full of paranoid drug dealers, to the end my friend

While I'm staring at the world through my rearview
see I'm seeing nothing but my dreams coming true
While I'm staring at the world through my rearview see
They got me staring at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beating fast cause it's time to die
Getting high, watching time fly, and all my motherfuckers
They got me staring at the world through my rearview

Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beating fast cause it's time to die (we)
Getting high, watching time fly, and all my motherfucker

Now you see em, now you don't, some niggaz
be here for the moment, and then they gone, what happened to em?
Well let's see, it seems to be a mystery
But all I know I never let the money get to me
Stay down like the, truest
Thug life until I check out of this bitch, I thought you'd know this
Who is, gonna catch me when I fall or even care to
While you thinking I see you lost up in my rearview
Half you, is down with them Outlawz

Outcast, left far, I feel like southpaws
But still we keep mashing til our dreams come through
Staring at the world through my rearview

Now I was raised as a young black male
In order to get paid, forced to make crack sales
Caught a nigga so they send me to these overpacked jails
In the cell, counting days in this living black Hell, do you feel me?
Keys to ignition, use at your discretion
Roll with a twelve gauge pump for protection
Niggaz hate me in the section from years of chin checking
Turn to Smith and Wesson war weapons

Heavenly Father I'm a soldier, I'm gettin hotter
cause the world's getting colder, baby let me hold ya
Talk to my guns like they fly bitches
All you bustas best to run look at my bitches
Now I know the answers to the question, do dreams come true

Still staring at the world through my rearview
I say
Now I know the answers to the question, do dreams come true
Still staring at the world through my rearview
They got me staring at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beating fast cause it's time to die

Getting high, watching time fly and all my motherfuckers
Staring at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beating fast cause it's time to die
Getting high, watchin time fly nigga can die

Back in the days we hustled for sneakers and beepers
Nine-six for glocks cause fiends hitting up blocks with street sweepers
Bless myself when knowing rules to these streets, somethin I learned
in school, on some Million Man March shit for the peace
True that, only one life to lead, a fast life of greed
Criminally addicted, infested since the seed

We all die, breed bleed like humans, towns run
by young guns, Outlawz and truants, shit's deep
Turn eighteen, burn my will when I go
Burn my body with my shotty, or choosing'my dough
So while you reminiscing all nights out with the crew
Smoke a blunt for me too while staring through your rearview

Hahahaha, you ain't knowin what we mean by staring through the rearview
So since you ain't knowin what we mean let me break down understanding
The world, the world is behind us
Once a motherfucker get an understanding on the game
and what the levels and the rules of the game is

Then the world ain't no trick no more
The world is a game to be played
So now we looking at the world, from like, behind us
Niggaz know what we gotta do, just gotta put our mind to it and do it
It's all about the papers, money rule the world
Bitches make the world go round
Real niggaz do they wanna do, bitch niggaz do what they can't
Staring at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beating fast cause it's time to die
Getting high, watching time fly, ya know
Staring at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beating fast cause it's time to die
Getting high, watching time fly and we'll be
Staring at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
heart beating fast... time to die
High, watching time fly, ya know
Staring at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you heart beating fast. time to die

They just can't stand the reign
Or the occasional pain
Of a man like me who goes against the grain.
Sometimes I do it in vain
So wit the little bass and treble ain't missed a
So it's time for me to explain that I'm the rebel.
Cold as the devil.
Straight from the underground, the rebel alone laughs.
They came to see the maniac sychopath.
The critics heard of me and the aftermath.
I don't give a damn and it shows.
A when I do a stage show I wear street clothes.
So they all know me: the lyrical lunatic, the maniac MC.
I give a shout out to your homies.
Maybe then, the critics'll leave your boy alone, G.
On the streets or on TV, it just don't pay the be a truth tellin MC.
They won't be happy till I'm banned.
The most dangerous weapon: an educated black man.
For point blank in your face, pump up the bass, and join the human race.
I throw peace to the Bay.
Cuz from the jungle to Oaktown, they backin me up all the way.
You know ya gotta love the sound.
It's from the rebel: the rebel of the underground.

He's the rebel: rebel of the underground (4X)

(2Pac)
Now I'm face to face with the devil.
Cuz they breedin more rebels than the whole damn ghetto.
And police brutality,
Put you in a nip and call it technicality.
So you reap what you soe.
So read the wrath of the rebel jackin em up once more.
Now the fox is in the henhouse.
Creepin up on your daughter, while you asleep
I got her sneakin out.
Tupac ain't nuttin nice.
I'll be nothin how I wanna and do it when I'm gonna.
Now I'm up to no good.
The mastermind of mischief movin more than most could.
So sit and slip into the sound.
Peep the rebel: the rebel of the underground.

He's the rebel: rebel of the underground (4X)

They say they hate me, they wanna hold me down.
I guess they scared of the rebel: the rebel of the underground.
But I never let it get me.
I just make another record 'bout the punks tryin to sweat me.
In fact, they tryin to keep me out.
Try to censor what I say cuz they don't like what I'm talkin 'bout.
So what's wrong with the media today.
Got brothers sellin out cuz they greedy to get paid.
But me, I'm comin from the soul.
And if it don't go gold, my story still get told.
And that way they can't stop me.
And if it sells a couple of copies, the punks'll try to copy.
It's sloppy, don't even try to.
I'm a slave to the rythm and I'm about to fly through.
Sold yo(ya-yo) to the people in the ghetto.
When ya hear the bass roll, go ahead and let go.
Now everybody wanna gangbang.
They talkin street slang, but the punk still can't hang.
By makin records bout violence
But when it comes to the real, some brothers go silent.
It kinda make you wanna think about
That ya gotta do some sellin out, just to get your record out.

Ain't nuttin' wrong with gettin' paid so nigga blaze
'Cause we some motherfuckin' fools

Walkin' through the streets wearin' jewels
Breakin' niggaz makin' moves

Big ballin' ass nigga named Trice

Now, I was born in Detroit on the side that's West
Troubled child comin' up, I had to ride I guess
Tried to apply myself, them niggaz was ballin'
My mama couldn't tell me shit, the streets was callin'
I was often involved with niggaz breakin' the law

I look back, 'Pac nigga, we was bankin' off raw
P-Funk got it pumpin', he had the connects
Threw the sack to his lil' niggaz workin' the set
And if you got it you gettin' wet, nigga bet on that
Don't come around, hurr, on that floss shit, Detroit niggaz off shit

Robbin' niggaz in the do'ways that's right
With my four-four that's the sure way
And this your road days, 'All Eyez On Me'
We was loonie I suppose, you could die, homie

O. Trice always rep his block
Pass the Henn and that ice, I'm on a track with 'Pac nigga

They wanna knows my role model, it's in a brown bottle

All About U
(feat. Nate Dogg, YGD Tha Top Dawg)

You probably crooked as the last trick
Wanna laugh about how I got my ass caught up with this bad bitch?
Thinking I had her but she had me in the long run
Its just my luck I'm stuck fuckin with wrong one, uh
Wise decisions based on lies we living
Skandalous times is games like my religion
You could be rolling with a thug
Instead you with this sweet scrub
Looking for some love
In every club, I see you standing like you want it
Well baby if ya got it better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin in walls as I pause
Addicted to the fast life
I try to holler but you tell me you're taken
Sayin you ain't impressed with the money I'm make
Guess its true what they telling me
Fresh out of jail lights hell for a black celebrity
So thats the reason why I call
And maybe you with it
Fantasies of the sweatin
Can I hit it? (hahaha)
Addicted to the things you do
Its still true what I'm saying Boo
Cause this is All About U

Every other city we go
Every other video
(its all about you)
No matter where I go
I see the same hoe
[repeat]

I'll make a promise if ya go with me
Just let me know, I'll have you hollering
My name out before I leave
Nobody loves me I'm a thug nigga
I only hang out with the criminals and the drug dealers
I love niggas
Cause we coming from the same place
Witness me holler at a hoochie, see how quick the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa
And I don't even care
Creep though
Weed smokes in the air
Everywhere I go, its all about the groupie hoes
waiting for niggas at the end of every show
I just seen ya in my friends video
Never put you on my friends so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm going through
It's All About U
(Yeah nigga, its All About U)

[Chorus 2X]

Is you sick from the dick or is it the flu?
It ain't about you or your bitch ass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty hoe
You think it's all about you?
Well, boo, I gets down like Dru and my nasty new niggas, too
You couldn't hold me back
It'll take a fatter track, a lyrical attack
Or perhaps it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your ?
Straight in control
?Flows are full?
Why hold a cold stroll?
Coldest set
I told you I'm as gold
And that's gold diggin
Cold diggin a ?
I slide in easily
Try a grizzly
Sluts know the cuts
I came to fuck
Try skeezin me
Runnin up in this
It's like ? when I bring ya the most
I fuck a bitch from the West coast

[Chorus 4X]

(You know what I'm saying?)
Every other city we go
I see the same hoes
In the studio, that kickin it in the video
It's gotta be the same ass and thighs
But you's a groupie baby, and don't look surprised
I can see it in your eyes, that you ain't nothing but a trick
Hanging with us, for some superstar dick
Want an autograph placed on her napkin
After she asks ""Ain't you the Top Dogg and don't you be rappin?""
She know whats crackin
Peep shows like Luke
From the limos, down to the Lexus coupes
We be flossin, and all females love that
Especially when you're dope, platinum, and your own ?
So when I met you
I really didn't have to say much
Cause me alone
Just made you want to taste and touch
Don't be trippin if I run up in you and your whole crew
I'ma still let you know girl, that it's all about you",5887630

Got nuttin but love for ya, do your thing boy

Yeah, all the homies that I ain't talk to in a while
I'ma send this one out for y'all, kna' mean?
Cause I ain't mad at cha
Heard y'all tearin' up shit out there, kickin' up dust
Givin' a motherfucker,
Yeah, niggas, mad at cha
'Cause I ain't mad at cha

Now we was once two niggas of the same kind
Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line
You was just a little smaller but you still roller
Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll
Member when you had a jheri curl didn't quite learn
On the block, witcha glock, trippin off sherm
Collect calls to the till, sayin' how ya changed
Oh you a Muslim now, no more dope game
Heard you might be comin' home, just got bail
Wanna go to the Mosque, don't wanna chase tail
I seems I lost my little homie he's a changed man
Hit the pen and now no sinnin' is the game plan
When I talk about money all you see is the struggle
When I tell you I'm livin' large you tell me it's trouble
Congratulation on the weddin', I hope your wife know
She got a playa for life, and that's no bullshittin'
I know we grew apart, you probably don't remember
I used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her
And I can see us after school, we'd bomb!
On the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
Now the whole shit's changed, and we don't even kick it
Got a big money scheme, and you ain't even with it
Hmm, knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker bad
Go toe to toe when it's time for roll you got a brother's back
And I can't even trip, 'cause I'm just laughin' at cha
You tryin' hard to maintain, then go head
'Cause I ain't mad at cha
(Hmm, I ain't mad at cha)

I ain't, mad, at cha (I ain't mad at cha)

I ain't, mad, at cha

We used to be like distant cousins, fightin', playin' dozens
Whole neighborhood buzzin', knowin', that we wasn't
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
I'm gettin' blitzed and I reminisce on all the times we shared
Besides bumpin' n grindin' wasn't nothin' on our mind
In time we learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back, to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony lovin the way the guns blow
And even though we separated, you said that you'd wait
Don't give nobody no coochie while I be locked up state
I kiss my Mama goodbye, and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said I'll return but I gotta fight the fate's arrived
Don't shed a tear, cause Mama I ain't happy here
I'm through trial, no more smiles, for a couple years
They got me goin' mad, I'm knockin' busters on they backs
In my cell, thinkin, ""Hell, I know one day I'll be back""
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl I'll be there, so prepare, to get fucked down

The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin' at cha
Cause youse a down ass bitch, and I ain't mad at cha

I ain't, mad, at cha (I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't, mad, at cha (A true down ass bitch, and I ain't mad at cha)

Well guess who's movin up, this nigga's ballin' now
Bitches be callin' to get it, hookers keep fallin' down
He went from nothin' to lots, ten carots to rock
Went from a nobody nigga to the big, man on the block
He's Mister local celebrity, addicted to move a key
Most hated by enemy, escape in the luxury
See, first you was our nigga but you made it, so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you why you faded, in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin' so high off that bomb hopin' we make it, to the better days
'Cause crime pays, and in time, you'll find a rhyme'll blaze
You'll feel the fire from the niggas in my younger days
So many changed on me, so many tried to plot
That I keep a glock beside my head, when will it stop?
Til God return me to my essence
'Cause even as a adolescents, I refuse to be a convalescent

So many questions, and they ask me if I'm still down
I moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now?
They got so much to say, but I'm just laughin' at cha
You niggas just don't know, but I ain't mad at cha

I ain't, mad at cha (and I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't mad (hell nah I ain't mad at cha) at cha
I ain't, mad at mha (and I ain't mad at cha)

Cause all I see is, murder murder, my mind state
preoccupied with homicide, tryin to survive through this crime rate
Dead bodies at block parties, those unlucky bastards
Gunfire now they require may be closed casket
Who can you blame?  It's insane what we dare do
Witness an evil that these men do, bitches in, too
In fact they be the reasons niggaz get to bleedin
Pull the fuckin fire when I leave em, you shoulda seen em
Hostile hoes catch elbows (beotch!) negroes disposed of
and snitches get dealt with, with no love
Body bags of adversaries that I had to bury
I broke the law and they jaw, all in the same flurry
But never worry, they'll remember me through history

when I awake and realize I'm just a prisoner in hell
Just as well, cause in my cell I'm keepin pictures of these bastards
Excersisin, visualizin, everyone inside a casket
Picture me blasted, surrounded by niggaz in masks
Sent with the task to harass and murder my ass
Will I last?  Heaven or Hell?  Freedom or jail?
Shit's hard, who can you tell?  Aand if we fail?
High speeds, and thai weed on the freeway
When will they learn to take it easy?  Uh
Drivebys and niggaz die, murder without a motive 
by making motherfuckers fry
Got me runnin from these coward-ass crooked-ass cops
Helicopters tryin to hover over niggaz til we drop
Got no time for the courts, my only thought is open fire
Hit the district attorney, but fuck that bitch, cause she's a lie
Now it's time to expire, I see the judge, spray the bitch
""Motherfuckers is crooked,"" is what I scream, and hit the fence
I comense to get wicked, spittin rounds as the plot thickens
Never missin an early grave is my only mission
If I die, never worry, bury me beside my four-five
May God forgive me, I was high, label me a

[Dramacydal]
Society lied to me, I ain't never gonna try to be
My mob'll be doin robberies, and stickups on these wannabe's
I witnessed niggaz lose they chest
For ordinary reasons niggaz bodies put to rest
So I just.. swallow my Beck's and holla, ""Fuck em!""
And if I'm next.. just let a nigga step with somethin
I ain't fearin nuttin

Young and thuggin, prepared for bustin if that's my destiny
Ready for whatever, see you niggaz can't get the best of me
(hold me down) Definitely no need for askin
(now he mad) Top speed (smokin weed) blasted (biotch!)

Cause when I bust em they gonna shiver, the killers cry
Soldiers got bodies floatin in the river, what is they sayin?
Talkin bout prayin -- they need to stop, that ain't gon' help
These niggaz sprayin up my block, tryin to take my wealth

Please God walk with me

Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone I grew up amongst a dying breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me can you feel me

No longer with us; he's deceased

Is there heaven for a G? Remember me

I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

Now that I'm struggling in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen
And fuck the world cause I'm cursed, I'm having visions
Of leaving here in a hearse, God can you feel me?
Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain
Show me some happiness again, I'm going blind
I spend my time in this cell, ain't living well
I know my destiny is Hell Where did I fail?
My life is in denial and when I die
Baptized in eternal fire I'll shed so many tears

I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

Now I'm lost and I'm weary So many tears
I'm suicidal so don't stand near me
My every move is a calculated step, to bring me closer
To embrace an early death, now there's nothing left
There was no mercy on the streets, I couldn't rest
I'm barely standing, bout to go to pieces, screamin' peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons trying to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched, sparking the flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just a misery
Painting a picture of my enemies killing me, in my sleep
Will I survive 'til the mornin' to see the sun
Please Lord forgive me for my sins, cause here I come

I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

Lord knows I tried, been a witness to homicide
Seen drive-bys takin' lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, getting high
This ain't the life for me, I wanna change
But ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to getting crazy
Disillusioned lately, I've been really wanting babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady cause she's a product of this poison
I'm hearing noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys, can't take no more
I'm fallin' to the floor; beggin' for the Lord to let me in
To Heaven's door -- Shed so many tears

If you tell me that you don't want it, that's a lie
Move close and let me whisper, some dirty words
in your ears as I kiss ya, on every curve

got me ready to release the fluid, sensation

Even the hardest of my homies need attention

Don't need lights, I can see you by the moonlight

And smokin' weed was an everyday thang in my household,
And drinking liquor til' you out cold
And tho' I'm gone now, nigga it's still on- Pow
Bustin' on them niggas till they gone
How many more jealous ass bitches, comin' for my riches
Now I gotta stay suspicious when I bone
Cause if I ain't sharp and heartless,
them bitches will start shit
Excuse me, but this is where we part bitch
No more game for free, please explain to me
Why niggas trip bitch, who you came to see?
Murderin' now but see me later man, as for my pops
I got homies that will hunt you til you drop
I hope the Lord will forgive me, I was a G
And gettin' high was a way of gettin' free
I see death around the corner

Chorus

This is for all the real mothafuckin' niggas out there
I know you ain't scared to die
We all gotta go, ya know ?
A real motherfucker will pick the time he goes
And make sure he handles his motherfuckin' business
Y'all niggas stop acting like pussies out there,
all right

(Movie bites)

I'm tired off getting ripped off by guys like that

I want his family dead, I want his house burned to the ground
I want to got there in the middle of the night,
I wanna piss on his head
I want his family dead, I want his house burned to the ground
I want to got there in the middle of the night,
I wanna piss on his head

I want that son of a bitch dead, I want him dead
I want him dead, I don't care",3524567
